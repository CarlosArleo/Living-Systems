# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 3:18:22 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

# Envision New Feature Prompt

## Objective

Given a question about a desired feature and the context of the existing codebase, generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. This proposal should consider the constraints and guidelines outlined in the project documentation.

## Inputs

*   **{question}**: A natural language question describing the desired feature.
*   **{codebaseContext}**: A description of the relevant parts of the existing codebase, including key technologies, data structures, and architectural patterns.

## Output

A Markdown-formatted architectural proposal that addresses the following:

*   **Feature Overview:** A concise summary of the feature and its purpose.
*   **Proposed Architecture:** A detailed description of the technical implementation, including:
    *   Data model changes (if any)
    *   API endpoint design (if applicable)
    *   Frontend component structure
    *   Integration with existing systems
    *   AI integration (if applicable)
*   **Justification:** Rationale for the chosen architecture, referencing relevant principles from the project documentation.
*   **Alternatives Considered:** A brief discussion of alternative approaches and why they were rejected.
*   **Open Questions:** Any unresolved questions or potential challenges.

## Example

**{question}**: How can we implement a feature that allows users to search for code snippets within the platform?

**{codebaseContext}**: The current platform uses Next.js for the frontend, Firebase for the backend (Firestore, Cloud Functions), and Genkit for AI processing. Code snippets are stored as documents in Firestore, with fields for title, description, language, and code content.

## Constraints

*   Adhere to the principles and guidelines outlined in the project documentation.
*   Prioritize maintainability, scalability, and testability.
*   Use existing technologies and infrastructure where possible.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Error Handling:** The `envisionNewFeature` function lacks a `try...catch` block around the `run` call. This violates the coding standards mandated by the CONSTITUTION (Section 3, Error Handling).  This could lead to unhandled exceptions and application crashes if the `run` function throws an error (e.g., network issue, model timeout).
2.  **Missing Justification for Model Choice:** The prompt uses `gemini-pro-1.5` without explanation. The CONSTITUTION (Section 6, Principle of Justification) requires explicit justification for significant architectural choices, including model selection.  While not a security risk, this lack of documentation hinders maintainability and future decision-making.
3.  **Potential Prompt Injection:** While the prompt itself is well-structured, the code replaces placeholders directly using string replacement. This opens the door to prompt injection vulnerabilities if `question` or `codebaseContext` contains malicious instructions.  An attacker could manipulate these inputs to alter the prompt's instructions, potentially leading to the AI model generating undesired or harmful outputs.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Wrap the `run` call in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors. Log the error and return a default value or throw a custom error to be handled upstream.
*   Add a comment justifying the choice of `gemini-pro-1.5`. Explain why this model is suitable for the task, considering factors like performance, cost, and capability.  Consider exploring alternative models and documenting the rationale for selecting the chosen one.
*   **CRITICAL:** Instead of string replacement, use a templating engine or structured prompt construction to prevent prompt injection.  This could involve passing the `question` and `codebaseContext` as separate parameters in a structured format to the `run` function or using a library that handles prompt construction securely.

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Violation of Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The code imports `envisionPrompt` from `../prompts/envision.prompt`.  The CONSTITUTION mandates that prompts MUST reside in `src/ai/prompts/` and be named exactly after the flow.  The import path suggests the prompt is one directory up, which is incorrect.  Furthermore, there's no guarantee that `envision.prompt` is not a TypeScript file, which is explicitly forbidden.

2. **Missing Contextual Information in Comments (3. Coding Standards & Idioms):** The comment explaining the model choice mentions cost-effectiveness. While cost is a factor, it doesn't explain the *why* in the context of regenerative principles.  How does this model choice contribute to the goals of the RDI platform and its mission of regenerative development?  This connection needs to be made explicit.

3. **Insufficient Error Handling (3. Coding Standards & Idioms):** While the code includes a `try...catch` block, it returns a generic error message. This is insufficient for debugging and doesn't provide the user with actionable information.  More specific error handling is required.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Move `envision.prompt` to `src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt` and ensure it is NOT a TypeScript file (`.ts` or `.tsx`). Correct the import path in `envision.ts` accordingly.
*   Expand the comment explaining the model choice.  Connect the choice of `gemini-pro-1.5` to the regenerative principles of the RDI platform. For example, explain if its performance characteristics contribute to resource efficiency or if its capabilities align with the analysis needs of the Five Capitals framework.  If alternatives were considered, explain *why* they were rejected in the context of the project's goals.
*   Improve error handling. Instead of returning a generic message, log the full error object for debugging purposes.  Consider returning a more specific error message to the user, perhaps categorized by error type (e.g., network error, model error, input error), or at least providing an error code that can be looked up.  If appropriate, implement retry logic for transient errors.

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL

  // Using gemini-pro-1.5 because it offers a good balance of performance and cost-effectiveness for this task.  It provides sufficient capabilities for analyzing code and suggesting new features within the context of the Five Capitals framework, while being resource-efficient in line with the RDI platform's focus on sustainable practices.

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Violation of Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The `envisionPrompt` is imported from `../prompts/envision.prompt`.  The CONSTITUTION mandates that prompts reside in `src/ai/prompts/`. The import path should be `'../prompts/envision.prompt'` (missing leading `/`).  This is a material flaw as it violates an explicit rule and will cause a runtime error.
2. **Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** The `question` and `codebaseContext` parameters are directly injected into the prompt without any sanitization. This opens the door to prompt injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate these parameters to alter the prompt's instructions, potentially extracting sensitive information or causing the AI to perform unintended actions.
3. **Missing Adherence to Constitution (1.4. Mandate Potential-Based Framing):** The code doesn't enforce the requirement that AI-generated summaries must conclude with a "Latent Potential" section.  While the prompt *might* include this instruction, the code itself provides no guarantee, and the returned result isn't checked for compliance. This violates an explicit directive.
4. **Suboptimal Error Handling:** While the code includes a `try...catch` block, returning the error message directly to the user is a security risk. It could leak sensitive information about the system's internal workings.  More importantly, it doesn't provide actionable information for debugging or monitoring.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Fix Import Path:** Correct the import path to `import envisionPrompt from '../prompts/envision.prompt';`.
*   **Sanitize Inputs:** Implement input sanitization for `question` and `codebaseContext`.  At a minimum, escape or remove any characters that could interfere with the prompt structure (e.g., backticks, triple quotes).  Consider using a dedicated library for robust sanitization.
*   **Enforce "Latent Potential":** After receiving the `result`, check if it contains a "Latent Potential" section. If not, either re-prompt the model with explicit instructions to include it or add a default "Latent Potential" section based on available data. Log a warning to indicate that the AI's initial response was incomplete.
*   **Improve Error Handling:**  Instead of returning the raw error message, return a generic error message to the user (e.g., "An error occurred while processing your request. Please try again later."). Log the full error details, including stack trace and relevant context, to a dedicated error logging service or the `system_health` collection in Firestore as mandated by the CONSTITUTION.  Include the `resourceName` (e.g., "envisionNewFeature") in the error log.

**3. Verdict:**
FAIL
