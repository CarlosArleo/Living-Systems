# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 2:21:58 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

*   Use Markdown formatting for clarity and structure.
```

```

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  Missing Error Handling: The `envisionNewFeature` function lacks proper error handling.  The `gemini.generate(prompt)` call should be wrapped in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during the AI generation process. This violates the coding standards defined in the CONSTITUTION (Section 3, Error Handling).
2.  Missing Adherence to Regenerative Principles: The prompt does not explicitly mention or enforce any of the regenerative principles (e.g., Wholeness, Potential-Based Framing, Engineer for Collaboration) from the CONSTITUTION (Section 1.4). This is a critical omission as it allows the AI to generate proposals that violate core project tenets.
3.  Potential Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection): While not a direct injection vulnerability in the traditional sense, the prompt construction is vulnerable to manipulation if `question` or `codebaseContext` contain unexpected Markdown formatting. This could lead to malformed output or, in more sophisticated attacks, potential exfiltration of information through cleverly crafted prompts.
4.  Missing Explicit Justification in Prompt: The prompt instructs the AI to "Adhere to the principles outlined in the project's architectural documentation" but doesn't provide the documentation itself or require the AI to explicitly cite which principles it is adhering to. This violates the "Principle of Justification" (Section 6) in the CONSTITUTION.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Add a `try...catch` block around the `gemini.generate(prompt)` call to handle potential errors. Log the error and return a default value or throw a custom error to be handled upstream.
*   Incorporate regenerative principles directly into the prompt. For example, add sections that specifically ask the AI to address Wholeness, Potential-Based Framing, and Engineer for Collaboration.  Require the AI to explicitly state how its proposal adheres to each principle.
*   Sanitize the `question` and `codebaseContext` inputs before inserting them into the prompt.  At minimum, escape any Markdown characters to prevent unintended formatting. Ideally, use a more robust sanitization library.
*   Provide a condensed version of the key architectural principles and directives within the prompt itself.  Require the AI to explicitly reference these principles when justifying its design choices.  For example: "Justify your design choices by referencing the following principles: [list of principles]."

// src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt
Given the following question and codebase context, generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format.

Question: {question}

Codebase Context: {codebaseContext}

The proposal should adhere to the following Regenerative Development Intelligence (RDI) Platform principles:

*   **Wholeness:** All new features must consider the interconnectedness of the Five Capitals framework and aggregate data from multiple sources.  Explain how your proposal addresses this principle.
*   **Potential-Based Framing:**  All proposals must identify opportunities and underutilized assets.  Describe the latent potential unlocked by your proposed feature.
*   **Engineer for Collaboration:**  New features involving community-facing data must include mechanisms for feedback and interaction.  Detail how your proposal facilitates collaboration.

Furthermore, consider these core architectural directives:

*   **Decoupled Full-Stack Architecture:** The frontend handles UX, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) manages business logic and data.  Justify your architectural choices in relation to this principle.
*   **Firestore Data Modeling:** Prioritize flattened, scalable data structures.  Avoid deeply nested data. Use subcollections for one-to-many relationships and root-level collections for many-to-many relationships. Explain your data modeling strategy and why it is the most efficient and scalable approach.
*   **Secure by Default:** All data access must be explicitly granted. Client-side write access to core business data is forbidden.  Describe how your proposal ensures data security.

Provide clear justifications for all design choices, referencing the principles and directives above. Include relevant code examples where appropriate. Use Markdown formatting for clarity and structure.
```
```typescript
// src/ai/utils/markdownUtils.ts
export const markdownEscape = (text: string): string => {
  return text.replace(/([`*_\[\]()#+\-.!])/g, '\\$1');
};

import { createLogger } from 'next/dist/build/output/log';

export const logger = createLogger({
    isServer: true
});
```

```

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Input Validation (Security):** The `envisionNewFeature` function in `src/ai/flows/envision.ts` does not validate the `codebaseContext` input. This is a critical security vulnerability as it opens the door to prompt injection attacks. A malicious actor could craft a `codebaseContext` string that modifies the prompt structure, potentially bypassing the intended constraints and causing the AI to execute unintended actions or reveal sensitive information.
2.  **Incorrect Logger Usage (Correctness & Logic):** The `logger` in `src/ai/utils/logger.ts` is initialized with `isServer: true`. This is incorrect for a Genkit flow, which can run in both server and client contexts. This could lead to logging issues in certain environments.
3.  **Potential Performance Bottleneck (Performance):**  While not a material issue *yet*, the reliance on string replacement in `envisionNewFeature` for injecting the `question` and `codebaseContext` into the prompt could become a performance bottleneck if the prompt becomes very large or complex.  This approach can lead to unnecessary string manipulations.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Implement Input Validation:** Sanitize the `codebaseContext` input in `envisionNewFeature` to prevent prompt injection. This could involve a combination of techniques:
    *   **Whitelisting:** Define a strict set of allowed characters and reject any input containing disallowed characters.
    *   **Escaping:**  Ensure that any special characters in the input are properly escaped to prevent them from being interpreted as part of the prompt structure.  While the current code attempts escaping for Markdown, it doesn't address potential injection within the prompt's logic itself. Consider a more robust escaping mechanism or a templating engine.
*   **Correct Logger Initialization:** Remove the `isServer: true` option from the `createLogger` call in `src/ai/utils/logger.ts` or make it dynamic based on the execution environment.  Consider using a more versatile logging library that handles both client and server-side logging seamlessly.
*   **Optimize Prompt Construction:**  Refactor the prompt construction to use a more efficient method, such as a template literal or a dedicated templating library. This will improve performance and readability, especially as the prompt grows in complexity.  For example:

```typescript
const prompt = `Given the following question and codebase context, generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format.

Question: ${sanitizedQuestion}

Codebase Context: ${sanitizedCodebaseContext}

... (rest of the prompt)`;
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** While the provided `sanitizeInput` function attempts to mitigate prompt injection by escaping backticks, it's insufficient.  A determined attacker could still bypass this by using alternative methods to inject malicious code into the prompt, such as exploiting Unicode characters or encoding techniques.  This is a critical security flaw as it allows an attacker to manipulate the prompt, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or executing arbitrary code within the Gemini model's context.  This violates the CONSTITUTION's "Secure by Default" mandate.
2. **Violation of Constitution (Master Prompts):** The CONSTITUTION mandates that "Each Genkit flow that calls an AI model **MUST** import its prompt from a dedicated `.prompt` file." The `envision.ts` flow constructs its prompt directly within the function instead of importing it from `src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt`. This violates a core architectural principle.
3. **Suboptimal Error Handling:** While the code includes a `try...catch` block, the error handling is too generic.  Returning a generic message like "Error generating architectural proposal. Please try again later." is not helpful for debugging or user experience.  More specific error messages, potentially based on the type of error caught, would improve maintainability and user experience.


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

* **Robust Prompt Injection Prevention:**  Replace the current `sanitizeInput` function with a more robust approach. Consider using a dedicated library for prompt sanitization or input validation that handles a wider range of potential attack vectors.  Alternatively, explore parameterizing the prompt template to prevent direct string interpolation of user input.
* **Use Master Prompts:** Move the prompt string from within the `envisionNewFeature` function to a dedicated file `src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt`. Then, import and use this prompt file in `envision.ts`. This adheres to the CONSTITUTION and improves maintainability.
* **Improved Error Handling:**  Provide more specific error messages in the `catch` block.  For example, differentiate between network errors, Gemini API errors, and input validation errors.  Log the full error object for debugging purposes.  Consider returning structured error responses that the frontend can use to display more informative messages to the user.  For instance:

```typescript
try {
  // ...
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Error in envisionNewFeature:', error);
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) { // Example custom error type
    return { error: 'Invalid input: ' + error.message };
  } else if (error instanceof GeminiAPIError) { // Another example
    return { error: 'Gemini API Error: ' + error.message };
  } else {
    return { error: 'An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.' };
  }
}
```
