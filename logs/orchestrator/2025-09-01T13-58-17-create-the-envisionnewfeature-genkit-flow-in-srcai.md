# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 1:58:17 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2. API & AI Flow Design - Master Prompts):** The prompt does not explicitly state which document contains the "project's architectural documentation."  While the CONSTITUTION exists, the prompt needs to directly reference it (e.g., CONTEXT.md) to comply with the "Master Prompts" rule, which mandates referencing the exact corresponding prompt.  This introduces ambiguity and violates the principle of Assumed Context.
    *   Code Snippet: `// src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt` (entire prompt)

2. **Adherence to Constitution (1.4. Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives - Enforce Wholeness, Mandate Potential-Based Framing, Engineer for Collaboration):** The prompt does not explicitly instruct the AI to consider the regenerative principles (Wholeness, Potential-Based Framing, Collaboration) when generating the architectural proposal. This is a critical omission, as these principles are fundamental to the project and must be considered in every design decision.
    *   Code Snippet: `// src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt` (entire prompt)

3. **Security Vulnerabilities (Lack of Input Validation):** The `envisionNewFeature` function does not validate the `question` or `codebaseContext` inputs.  Malicious or unexpectedly formatted input could lead to unpredictable behavior or potentially expose the system to prompt injection attacks.
    *   Code Snippet:
        ```typescript
        const envisionNewFeature = async (question: string, codebaseContext: string): Promise<string> => {
          // ...
        };
        ```

4. **Readability & Maintainability (Lack of Comments):** The `envisionNewFeature` function lacks comments explaining the *why* behind the code. While the function is relatively simple, a brief explanation of its purpose and how it fits into the larger system would improve maintainability.
    *   Code Snippet: `// src/ai/flows/envision.ts` (entire file)


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Modify the prompt to explicitly reference the CONSTITUTION (CONTEXT.md) as the source of architectural principles.  For example:  "Adhere to the principles outlined in the project's architectural documentation (CONTEXT.md)."
*   Incorporate the regenerative principles (Wholeness, Potential-Based Framing, Collaboration) as explicit requirements in the prompt.  For example, add a section: "Regenerative Design Considerations: Ensure the proposed architecture adheres to the following regenerative principles as defined in CONTEXT.md: [list principles and briefly explain them]."
*   Implement input validation for `question` and `codebaseContext` in the `envisionNewFeature` function.  At a minimum, sanitize the inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure they conform to expected formats.  Consider using a schema validation library.
*   Add comments to `envisionNewFeature` explaining its purpose and how it relates to the overall envisioning process.

## Attempt #2

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The prompt does not explicitly reference the required `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document.  While the prompt mentions adhering to `CONTEXT.md`, the CONSTITUTION mandates using specific prompts from the `AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`.

    *   Code Snippet: `// src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt` (The entire prompt file)
    *   Explanation: The CONSTITUTION explicitly states: "Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted." This prompt, while well-written, is ad-hoc and therefore non-compliant.

2. **Security Vulnerabilities (3):** The prompt itself is vulnerable to prompt injection. While this specific instance might not have immediate security implications, it sets a dangerous precedent.  A malicious user could craft a `question` or `codebaseContext` that manipulates the prompt to generate undesired outputs or reveal sensitive information.

    *   Code Snippet: `// src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt` (Specifically the variable interpolations `{{question}}` and `{{codebaseContext}}`)
    *   Explanation:  Without proper sanitization or escaping of the input variables, a user could inject Markdown or even JavaScript into the prompt, potentially altering its logic or exposing vulnerabilities in the downstream system.

3. **Readability & Maintainability (5):** While the code is generally well-written, the prompt lacks specific references to sections within `CONTEXT.md`. This makes it harder for a developer (or another AI agent) to understand the *why* behind specific architectural decisions made by the LLM.

    *   Code Snippet: `// src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt` (Specifically the "Regenerative Design Considerations" section)
    *   Explanation: The prompt mentions "Wholeness," "Potential-Based Framing," and "Collaboration" but doesn't link these principles to specific sections or directives within `CONTEXT.md`. This reduces traceability and makes it harder to verify compliance.


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Replace the current `envision.prompt` with the exact prompt specified in `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` for the "envision" flow. If no such prompt exists, create one and ensure it adheres to all CONSTITUTIONAL guidelines.
*   Sanitize or escape the `question` and `codebaseContext` variables before injecting them into the prompt.  Consider using a templating engine that handles escaping automatically or implement a dedicated sanitization function.  Research best practices for preventing prompt injection attacks.
*   In the prompt, add explicit references to the relevant sections of `CONTEXT.md` for each regenerative principle. For example, instead of just saying "Wholeness," say "Wholeness (see CONTEXT.md, section 1.4. Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives)."  This improves traceability and reinforces the importance of the CONSTITUTION.

## New Feature Architectural Proposal

**Question:** {{question}}

**Codebase Context:** {{codebaseContext}}

Based on the provided question and codebase context, generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format.  Consider the following constraints and guidelines from the project's architectural documentation (CONTEXT.md):

*   Use Next.js, Tailwind CSS, the `shadcn/ui` component library, Firebase, Genkit, and Mapbox GL JS where appropriate (see CONTEXT.md, section 1.3. Technology Stack).
*   The backend should utilize Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit for AI processing (see CONTEXT.md, section 2.1. Overall Architecture).
*   All UI elements should be built with `shadcn/ui` components (see CONTEXT.md, section 1.3. Technology Stack).
*   Address data modeling, API design (if applicable), and integration with existing systems (see CONTEXT.md, section 2.2. API & AI Flow Design).
*   Provide clear justifications for architectural choices, referencing relevant sections of CONTEXT.md (see CONTEXT.md, section 6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules), Principle of Justification).

**Regenerative Design Considerations (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y. Regenerative Principles):**

Ensure the proposed architecture adheres to the following regenerative principles:

*   **Wholeness (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y.Z. Wholeness):**  Consider the interconnectedness of the system and its impact on the larger ecosystem.
*   **Potential-Based Framing (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y.Z. Potential-Based Framing):** Focus on the potential positive outcomes and opportunities for growth and evolution.
*   **Collaboration (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y.Z. Collaboration):** Design for collaboration and shared ownership, both within the system and with external stakeholders.

## Attempt #3

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2 API & AI Flow Design):** The prompt file (`envision.prompt`) references non-existent sections in `CONTEXT.md` (e.g., "section X.Y. Regenerative Principles," "section X.Y.Z. Wholeness"). This violates the requirement that all prompts must use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document and accurately reference the `CONTEXT.md` file.  Furthermore, the CONSTITUTION mandates that Master Prompts reside in `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`, but this prompt is located in `src/ai/prompts/`.

   ```markdown
   // src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt (incorrect references)
   Regenerative Design Considerations (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y. Regenerative Principles):
   Wholeness (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y.Z. Wholeness):
   ```

2. **Adherence to Constitution (1.4 Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives - Mandate Potential-Based Framing):** The prompt does not explicitly require the AI to include a "Latent Potential" section in its output, violating the "Mandate Potential-Based Framing" directive.

   ```markdown
   // src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt (missing Latent Potential requirement)
   // No explicit mention of "Latent Potential" in the output format.
   ```

3. **Security Vulnerabilities (3):** While the code uses `DOMPurify.sanitize`, it's being used inconsistently. The returned result from the AI isn't sanitized, opening a potential XSS vulnerability.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/flows/envision.ts (missing sanitization on result)
   const result = await run({ /* ... */ });
   return result; // Result is not sanitized
   ```

4. **Readability & Maintainability (5):** The comment explaining the purpose of `envisionNewFeature` mentions adherence to `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`.  However, the CONSTITUTION states that Master Prompts should be within that document, which isn't the case here. This creates confusion and makes maintenance more difficult.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/flows/envision.ts (misleading comment)
   /**
    * ...
    * It adheres to the principles outlined in docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md.
    * ...
    */
   ```


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Correct the section references in `envision.prompt` to accurately point to the relevant sections in `CONTEXT.md`. Move the prompt to the correct location in `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`.
*   Explicitly add a requirement for a "Latent Potential" section in the `envision.prompt` output.  For example: "The proposal MUST include a dedicated section titled 'Latent Potential' outlining opportunities and underutilized assets."
*   Sanitize the `result` from the AI using `DOMPurify.sanitize(result)` before returning it in `envisionNewFeature`.
*   Update the comment in `envisionNewFeature` to accurately reflect the location and usage of the prompt.  For example: "This flow uses the 'envision' prompt defined in `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`."  Ensure the prompt is indeed located there.

## New Feature Architectural Proposal

**Question:** {{question}}

**Codebase Context:** {{codebaseContext}}

Based on the provided question and codebase context, generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format.  Consider the following constraints and guidelines from the project's architectural documentation (CONTEXT.md):

*   Use Next.js, Tailwind CSS, the `shadcn/ui` component library, Firebase, Genkit, and Mapbox GL JS where appropriate (see CONTEXT.md, section 1.3. Technology Stack).
*   The backend should utilize Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit for AI processing (see CONTEXT.md, section 2.1. Overall Architecture).
*   All UI elements should be built with `shadcn/ui` components (see CONTEXT.md, section 1.3. Technology Stack).
*   Address data modeling, API design (if applicable), and integration with existing systems (see CONTEXT.md, section 2.2. API & AI Flow Design).
*   Provide clear justifications for architectural choices, referencing relevant sections of CONTEXT.md (see CONTEXT.md, section 6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules), Principle of Justification).

**Regenerative Design Considerations (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y. Regenerative Principles):**

Ensure the proposed architecture adheres to the following regenerative principles:

*   **Wholeness (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y.Z. Wholeness):**  Consider the interconnectedness of the system and its impact on the larger ecosystem.
*   **Potential-Based Framing (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y.Z. Potential-Based Framing):** Focus on the potential positive outcomes and opportunities for growth and evolution.
*   **Collaboration (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y.Z. Collaboration):** Design for collaboration and shared ownership, both within the system and with external stakeholders.


**Output Format:**

The output should be a single Markdown string containing the architectural proposal.

          AUDIT REPORT: ### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2 API & AI Flow Design):** The prompt file (`envision.prompt`) references non-existent sections in `CONTEXT.md` (e.g., "section X.Y. Regenerative Principles," "section X.Y.Z. Wholeness"). This violates the requirement that all prompts must use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document and accurately reference the `CONTEXT.md` file.  Furthermore, the CONSTITUTION mandates that Master Prompts reside in `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`, but this prompt is located in `src/ai/prompts/`.

   ```markdown
   // src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt (incorrect references)
   Regenerative Design Considerations (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y. Regenerative Principles):
   Wholeness (see CONTEXT.md, section X.Y.Z. Wholeness):
   ```

2. **Adherence to Constitution (1.4 Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives - Mandate Potential-Based Framing):** The prompt does not explicitly require the AI to include a "Latent Potential" section in its output, violating the "Mandate Potential-Based Framing" directive.

   ```markdown
   // src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt (missing Latent Potential requirement)
   // No explicit mention of "Latent Potential" in the output format.
   ```

3. **Security Vulnerabilities (3):** While the code uses `DOMPurify.sanitize`, it's being used inconsistently. The returned result from the AI isn't sanitized, opening a potential XSS vulnerability.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/flows/envision.ts (missing sanitization on result)
   const result = await run({ /* ... */ });
   return result; // Result is not sanitized
   ```

4. **Readability & Maintainability (5):** The comment explaining the purpose of `envisionNewFeature` mentions adherence to `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`.  However, the CONSTITUTION states that Master Prompts should be within that document, which isn't the case here. This creates confusion and makes maintenance more difficult.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/flows/envision.ts (misleading comment)
   /**
    * ...
    * It adheres to the principles outlined in docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md.
    * ...
    */
   ```


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Correct the section references in `envision.prompt` to accurately point to the relevant sections in `CONTEXT.md`. Move the prompt to the correct location in `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`.
*   Explicitly add a requirement for a "Latent Potential" section in the `envision.prompt` output.  For example: "The proposal MUST include a dedicated section titled 'Latent Potential' outlining opportunities and underutilized assets."
*   Sanitize the `result` from the AI using `DOMPurify.sanitize(result)` before returning it in `envisionNewFeature`.
*   Update the comment in `envisionNewFeature` to accurately reflect the location and usage of the prompt.  For example: "This flow uses the 'envision' prompt defined in `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`."  Ensure the prompt is indeed located there.

**3. Verdict:**
