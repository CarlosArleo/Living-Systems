# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 3:05:33 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

# Envision New Feature Prompt

## Objective

This prompt aims to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format for a new feature, considering the provided question and codebase context.  The proposal should adhere to the architectural principles and technology stack defined in the project documentation.

## Inputs

*   **{question}**: A natural language question describing the desired new feature.
*   **{codebaseContext}**: Relevant code snippets or descriptions of the existing codebase related to the new feature.

## Output

A Markdown formatted architectural proposal detailing the following aspects:

*   **Feature Overview:** A concise summary of the new feature.
*   **Technical Design:** A detailed explanation of the technical implementation, including:
    *   Data model changes (if any).
    *   API endpoint design (if applicable).
    *   Frontend component structure.
    *   AI integration (if relevant).
*   **Dependencies:** Any new libraries or services required.
*   **Testing Strategy:** An outline of the testing approach for the new feature, including unit, integration, and E2E tests.
*   **Deployment Considerations:** Any specific deployment steps or configurations.

## Instructions

1.  Carefully analyze the provided `{question}` and `{codebaseContext}`.
2.  Design a robust and scalable architecture for the new feature, adhering to the project's established principles and technology stack (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI, Firebase, Gemini, Genkit, Mapbox GL JS).
3.  Provide a detailed explanation of the technical design, including clear justifications for architectural choices.
4.  Outline a comprehensive testing strategy, ensuring adequate coverage and adherence to the project's testing philosophy.
5.  Consider any potential deployment challenges and provide solutions.
6.  Format the output as a well-structured Markdown document.


## Example

**{question}**: "How can we implement a feature that allows users to upload and analyze GeoJSON files, visualizing the data on a map?"

**{codebaseContext}**: "Existing map components use Mapbox GL JS.  Firebase Cloud Storage is used for file storage."


## Expected Output (Example)

```markdown
# Architectural Proposal: GeoJSON Upload and Analysis

## Feature Overview

This feature allows users to upload GeoJSON files, analyze their contents, and visualize the data on an interactive map.

## Technical Design

1.  **Upload:** Users upload GeoJSON files via a new API endpoint (`/api/uploadGeoJSON`). The file is stored in Firebase Cloud Storage.
2.  **Analysis:** A Genkit flow (`analyzeGeoJSON`) processes the uploaded file, extracting relevant information (e.g., feature types, bounding box).
3.  **Visualization:** The extracted data is passed to the existing Mapbox GL JS map component, which renders the GeoJSON data as a new layer.

## Dependencies

None.

## Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Test the `analyzeGeoJSON` flow and the new API endpoint.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the entire upload, analysis, and visualization flow.
*   **E2E Tests:** Test the user interaction with the upload form and map visualization.

## Deployment Considerations

None.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Error Handling:** The `envisionNewFeature` function lacks a `try...catch` block. This violates the coding standards mandated by the CONSTITUTION (Section 3, Error Handling), which requires all asynchronous operations to be wrapped in `try...catch` blocks. This could lead to unhandled exceptions and application crashes.
2.  **Missing Authentication in Prompt:** The prompt does not explicitly mention or require any form of authentication for the proposed API endpoint (`/api/uploadGeoJSON` in the example). This is a critical security vulnerability, as it could allow unauthorized users to upload arbitrary files, potentially leading to storage abuse or other security risks. This violates Section 4, "Security & Governance Mandates" of the CONSTITUTION.
3.  **Missing Justification for Architectural Choices in Prompt:** The prompt instructs the AI to adhere to architectural principles but doesn't provide a mechanism for the AI to demonstrate that adherence.  This makes it difficult to verify that the generated proposals are compliant. This violates Section 6, "AI Agent Interaction Protocols" (Principle of Justification).
4. **Potential Security Vulnerability in Prompt Example:** The example output in the prompt suggests storing the uploaded GeoJSON directly in Firebase Cloud Storage and then processing it. This opens up a potential vulnerability where malicious GeoJSON data could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the `analyzeGeoJSON` flow or the Mapbox GL JS library.  While the prompt mentions an `analyzeGeoJSON` flow, it doesn't specify any validation or sanitization steps, which is a critical security concern.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Wrap the `run` call within a `try...catch` block in `envisionNewFeature` to handle potential errors during AI execution. Log the error and return a default value or an error message.
*   Modify the prompt to explicitly require authentication for any proposed API endpoints.  Include a section in the "Expected Output" that demonstrates how authentication would be implemented (e.g., using Firebase Authentication).
*   Add a section to the prompt's "Output" section requiring the AI to provide explicit justifications for its architectural choices, referencing the CONSTITUTION. For example, if the AI proposes a new subcollection, it should explain why this is the correct choice according to the data modeling guidelines.
*   Update the prompt example to include security considerations.  Specifically, mention the need for validation and sanitization of the uploaded GeoJSON data before processing and visualization.  Consider suggesting a more secure approach, such as processing the GeoJSON on the server and only sending the processed data to the client for visualization.

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL

```

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Violation of Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The `envision.ts` flow imports `envision.prompt`.  This implies the prompt file should be `envision.prompt`, but the audit cannot confirm the file type without access to the file system. If `envision.prompt` is actually a TypeScript file (e.g., `envision.prompt.ts`), this is a direct violation of the CONSTITUTION.
2. **Security Vulnerability (3. Security & Governance Mandates):** The code lacks any form of input validation for `question` and `codebaseContext`. This opens the door to prompt injection attacks. Malicious users could craft inputs that manipulate the prompt to bypass intended functionality or extract sensitive information.
3. **Missing Error Handling Detail (3. Coding Standards & Idioms):** While the code includes a `try...catch` block, the error handling is too generic.  Simply logging the error to the console and returning a generic error message is insufficient for debugging and monitoring.  The specific error details should be included in the returned message (in a safe way, avoiding leakage of sensitive information) or logged to a dedicated error tracking service.  This is especially important given the performance KPI of a maximum 0.1% error rate (7. Performance & Health KPIs).  Without detailed error information, it will be difficult to diagnose and address the root causes of errors, potentially leading to KPI violations.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

* **Verify Prompt File Type:** Ensure that `envision.prompt` is a plain text file and NOT a TypeScript file (e.g., `envision.prompt.ts`).  Rename if necessary to comply with the CONSTITUTION.
* **Implement Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate both `question` and `codebaseContext` before using them in the prompt.  This could involve limiting input length, escaping special characters, or using a whitelist approach to restrict allowed characters.  Consider the context and potential risks associated with each input.  For example, if `codebaseContext` is expected to be a file path, ensure it doesn't contain directory traversal sequences.
* **Improve Error Handling:**  Instead of returning a generic error message, provide more context.  Log the full error object (including stack trace) to a dedicated error tracking service.  For the returned message to the user, consider a more informative but safe message like, "An error occurred during architectural proposal generation. Please try again later. (Error Code: [Unique Error ID])."  This allows for tracking and correlation of errors without exposing sensitive details.  Consider implementing a centralized error handling mechanism that categorizes errors and provides actionable insights.

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL


## Attempt #3

### Generated Code (Attempt #3)

```typescript
// src/ai/flows/envision.ts
import { run } from 'genkit';
import envisionPrompt from '../prompts/envision.prompt'; // Fixed import

const envisionNewFeature = async (question: string, codebaseContext: string): Promise<string> => {
  // Basic input sanitization - escape special characters
  const safeQuestion = question.replace(/[<>&'"]/g, '');
  const safeCodebaseContext = codebaseContext.replace(/[<>&'"]/g, '');

  const prompt = envisionPrompt.replace('{question}', safeQuestion).replace('{codebaseContext}', safeCodebaseContext);
  try {
    const result = await run({
      model: 'gemini-pro-1.5',
      prompt,
    });
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    const errorId = 'ERR-XXX'; // Placeholder for a unique error ID generation mechanism
    console.error('Error in envisionNewFeature:', error, errorId);
    return `An error occurred during architectural proposal generation. Please try again later. (Error Code: ${errorId})`;
  }
};

export default envisionNewFeature;
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Incomplete Error Handling:** While the code includes a `try...catch` block, the error handling is incomplete.  The error ID `'ERR-XXX'` is a placeholder and doesn't provide useful information for debugging or tracking.  Furthermore, the error is only logged to the console.  According to the CONSTITUTION (Coding Standards & Idioms), errors should be handled gracefully.  In a production environment, this would mean logging the error to a centralized error tracking service and potentially triggering alerts.  More importantly, the CONSTITUTION mandates recording KPI violations in the `system_health` collection, which is not being done here.  Since an error in this flow would likely violate the "Max Error Rate" KPI, a record should be created in Firestore.
2. **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The input sanitization is insufficient and could lead to prompt injection vulnerabilities.  Simply escaping HTML characters is not enough.  A malicious user could still craft inputs that manipulate the prompt structure, potentially leading to unexpected or harmful outputs.  This violates the "Security & Governance Mandates" section of the CONSTITUTION.
3. **Missing Adherence to Regenerative Principles:** The CONSTITUTION's "Mandate Potential-Based Framing" dictates that all AI-generated text summaries MUST conclude with a section titled "Latent Potential."  This code provides no mechanism to ensure this requirement is met.  This is a direct violation of the CONSTITUTION.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Robust Error Handling:** Replace the placeholder error ID with a proper UUID generation mechanism. Integrate with an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to capture and analyze errors.  Crucially, add logic within the `catch` block to create a record in the `system_health` collection when an error occurs, specifying the `metric` as "Max Error Rate", the `measuredValue` as 1 (representing 100% error for this specific invocation), and the `resourceName` as "envisionNewFeature".  Include the generated error ID in this record.
*   **Enhanced Input Sanitization:** Implement more robust input sanitization. Consider using a library specifically designed for prompt engineering security, or at minimum, strictly whitelist allowed characters instead of blacklisting a small subset.  Alternatively, explore using structured prompting techniques to avoid string interpolation altogether.
*   **Enforce Latent Potential:** Modify the `envisionPrompt` and the code to ensure that the AI-generated response always includes a "Latent Potential" section.  This could involve adding specific instructions to the prompt or post-processing the AI's output to append the section if missing.  Consider adding a check within the flow itself to validate the presence of this section before returning the result.  If the section is missing, either retry the prompt with adjusted instructions or log an error and return a suitable message to the user.
