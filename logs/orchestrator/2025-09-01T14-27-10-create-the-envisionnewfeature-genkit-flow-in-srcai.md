# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 2:27:10 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Error Handling:** The `gemini.generate(prompt)` call lacks a `try...catch` block. This violates the coding standards mandated by the CONSTITUTION (Section 3, Error Handling) and could lead to application crashes if the AI call fails.
2.  **Missing Adherence to Regenerative Principle (Enforce Wholeness):** The prompt does not explicitly instruct the AI to consider the "Enforce Wholeness" principle from the CONSTITUTION (Section 1.4). This could lead to generated proposals that violate this core architectural principle.
3.  **Missing Adherence to Regenerative Principle (Mandate Potential-Based Framing):** The prompt does not instruct the AI to include a "Latent Potential" section in its output, as required by the CONSTITUTION (Section 1.4). This could result in incomplete or negatively framed proposals.
4.  **Missing Adherence to Regenerative Principle (Engineer for Collaboration):** The prompt does not explicitly address the "Engineer for Collaboration" principle (Section 1.4).  Generated proposals might lack considerations for community feedback and interaction, which is a critical requirement.
5.  **Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):**  The direct use of `.replace('{question}', question)` and `.replace('{codebaseContext}', codebaseContext)` without sanitization opens the prompt to injection attacks. A malicious user could manipulate the `question` or `codebaseContext` variables to inject their own instructions into the prompt, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code or the disclosure of sensitive information.


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Wrap the `gemini.generate(prompt)` call in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully. Log the error and return a default value or throw a custom error to be handled upstream.
*   Modify the prompt to explicitly instruct the AI to consider the "Enforce Wholeness," "Mandate Potential-Based Framing," and "Engineer for Collaboration" principles.  Add specific instructions and examples to guide the AI's output.
*   Sanitize the `question` and `codebaseContext` inputs before inserting them into the prompt.  Consider using a templating library or a safer string formatting method that escapes special characters.  Alternatively, explore parameterizing the prompt within the `gemini.generate` call if the library supports it.
*   Add clear instructions in the prompt regarding the expected format and content of the "Latent Potential" section.
*   Add instructions in the prompt to ensure the generated proposals include considerations for community feedback mechanisms, aligning with the "Engineer for Collaboration" principle.


**3. Verdict:**

FAIL

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Potential Prompt Injection:** The `envisionNewFeature` function sanitizes the input by escaping curly braces and backslashes. However, this is insufficient to prevent prompt injection.  A malicious user could still manipulate the prompt structure by introducing other special characters or Markdown formatting that alters the intended behavior of the prompt.  This is a **CRITICAL** security vulnerability.
2.  **Missing Adherence to Constitution (Master Prompts):** The prompt file (`envision.prompt`) does not explicitly mention adherence to the specific rules and directives outlined in the CONSTITUTION. While the prompt mentions regenerative principles, it lacks the required explicit references to the CONSTITUTION to ensure the AI agent prioritizes these rules. This is a **MATERIAL** flaw as it undermines the governance structure.
3. **Missing Explicit Error Handling in Prompt:** The prompt itself lacks instructions on how to handle errors or unexpected input. This could lead to unpredictable behavior from the LLM and should be explicitly addressed within the prompt.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Robust Prompt Injection Prevention:** Instead of attempting to sanitize the input, use a structured approach to prompt construction.  Avoid direct string interpolation of user-provided data into the prompt template.  Instead, pass the user input as separate parameters to the LLM and design the prompt to explicitly reference these parameters in a safe and controlled manner.  Consider using a templating engine that supports structured data or a dedicated prompt management library.  This is crucial to mitigate the prompt injection vulnerability.
*   **Explicit CONSTITUTION Reference in Prompt:**  Modify the `envision.prompt` file to include an explicit reference to the CONSTITUTION.  For example, add a section at the beginning stating: "Before generating the proposal, you MUST review and strictly adhere to the RDI Platform Constitution provided in separate context.  All decisions and recommendations must be justified by referencing the relevant sections of the CONSTITUTION."  This reinforces the governance structure and ensures the AI agent prioritizes the defined rules.
*   **Error Handling in Prompt:** Add instructions to the prompt on how to handle errors or unexpected input. For example: "If the provided `codebaseContext` is empty or invalid, return a Markdown formatted response explaining the issue and suggesting next steps. Do not attempt to generate an architectural proposal without valid context." This will make the LLM's behavior more predictable and robust.
*   **Consider Context Window Limits:**  Be mindful of the context window limitations of the chosen LLM.  If the `codebaseContext` is excessively long, it might exceed the limit, leading to truncated or irrelevant outputs.  Consider strategies for summarizing or chunking the codebase context if necessary.

**3. Verdict:**
FAIL

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Violation of Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The prompt file (`envision.prompt`) is correctly associated with the flow (`envision.ts`), but the prompt file content itself does not reside within a code block. This makes the prompt harder to read and maintain, especially for complex prompts with code examples.  While not explicitly forbidden, it deviates from the spirit of the constitution which emphasizes clarity and maintainability.
2.  **Missing Input Validation (3. Security Vulnerabilities):** The `envisionNewFeature` function does not validate the `question` or `codebaseContext` inputs.  Malicious or unexpected input could lead to unexpected behavior or, in the worst case, prompt injection vulnerabilities.
3.  **Missing Adherence to Constitution (1.4. Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives - Mandate Potential-Based Framing):** The prompt *does* request a "Latent Potential" section, but the code itself doesn't verify that the AI actually provides it.  The function blindly returns the AI's output without checking for completeness according to the constitution.
4.  **Missing Error Handling Detail (3. Coding Standards & Idioms - Error Handling):** While the code includes a `try...catch` block, it only logs the error to the console and returns a generic error message. This lacks sufficient detail for debugging and doesn't provide actionable information to the user.  More specific error handling is needed.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Enclose Prompt in Code Block:** Wrap the entire content of `envision.prompt` within a Markdown code block (triple backticks). This improves readability and allows for better syntax highlighting.  Consider specifying the language (e.g., ```markdown`).
*   **Implement Input Validation:** Add input validation for both `question` and `codebaseContext`. At a minimum, check for empty or null values.  Consider sanitizing the input to prevent potential injection attacks.  For `codebaseContext`, depending on its expected format, more rigorous validation might be necessary.
*   **Enforce "Latent Potential" Section:** After receiving the AI's response, parse the Markdown output and verify that a "Latent Potential" section exists. If not, either re-prompt the AI or return a more specific error message indicating the missing section.
*   **Improve Error Handling:**  Instead of just logging the error, capture more specific error information (e.g., error message, stack trace, potentially the prompt inputs that caused the error).  Return a more informative error message to the user, potentially with an error code for easier tracking.  Consider different error handling strategies for different error types (e.g., network errors vs. AI generation errors).  Log the detailed error information to a centralized logging service for debugging and monitoring.

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL
