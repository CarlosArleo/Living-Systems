```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **1.1. Mission & Purpose**

The RDI Platform's core purpose is to augment the practice of regenerative development. It is a "great translator" that helps practitioners analyze complex, place-based data through the lens of the **Five Capitals framework** to reveal a place's unique character and evolutionary potential. The goal is to move beyond sustainability (doing less harm) to active regeneration (making systems healthier and more capable).


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **Preamble**

This document is the master context and single source of truth for the AI agent developing the Regenerative Development Intelligence (RDI) Platform. It is the ultimate authority on all matters of architecture, coding standards, security, and design. All generated code and system artifacts must strictly adhere to the principles and mandates defined herein. This is a living document, version-controlled alongside the source code, and serves as the long-term memory and evolving intelligence of the project.

**SENSORY DETECTOR REPORT:**

`FAIL`

**Justification:**

1. **Missing Metadata:** The DNA mandates that all new components and pages should include metadata for SEO and accessibility. The provided `App.tsx` is missing this crucial metadata.  This violates section 3 (Coding Standards & Idioms) which emphasizes best practices.

2. **Missing Error Handling:** While not directly interacting with an API or database, the DNA's emphasis on `try...catch` blocks for all asynchronous operations (Section 3, Coding Standards & Idioms) suggests a best practice of defensive coding.  While not strictly a violation, adding error boundaries or other error handling mechanisms would enhance the robustness and regenerative capacity of the application, aligning with the overall project philosophy.  This is especially important as the application evolves and integrates more complex data fetching and interactions.

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

```
FAIL
```

The provided code defines types and sample data for the Five Capitals framework, which aligns with the project's mission. However, it does *not* implement any functionality related to data persistence, API endpoints, or the required integration with Firestore, as mandated by the Project Constitution.  Specifically:

* **Violation of 1.3. Technology Stack & 2.3 Firestore Data Modeling:** The code does not interact with Firestore at all.  The `capitals` array is in memory.  The DNA mandates that data be stored and retrieved from Firestore.
* **Violation of 1.4. Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives (Enforce Wholeness):**  There are no API endpoints or Server Components present.  The DNA requires that any code returning data for display must aggregate data from at least two different Firestore collections representing different Capitals.
* **Violation of 4. Security & Governance Mandates:**  Without Firestore integration and backend logic, the critical security mandates around access control and forced backend logic cannot be implemented.

This code represents an incomplete implementation and requires significant changes to align with the project's DNA.  It lacks the core architectural elements and data persistence strategy required by the RDI Platform.


## Attempt #3

### Corrected Code (Attempt #3)

```typescript
// types.ts
export interface Capital {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  indicators: Indicator[];
}

export interface Indicator {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  unit: string;
  value?: number; // Optional value for the indicator
}

// capitals.ts
import { Capital } from './types';
import { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFunctions, httpsCallable } from 'firebase/functions';

// Initialize Firebase (replace with your config)
const firebaseConfig = {
  // ... your Firebase config ...
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = getFirestore(app);
const functions = getFunctions(app);

export const getCapitals = async (): Promise<Capital[]> => {
  const getCombinedCapitals = httpsCallable(functions, 'getCombinedCapitals');

  try {
    const result = await getCombinedCapitals();
    return result.data as Capital[];
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching capitals:", error);
    return []; // Return empty array on error
  }
};


// Example usage (in a server component or API endpoint)
// export async function getServerSideProps() {
//   const capitals = await getCapitals();
//   return {
//     props: { capitals }
//   }
// }
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

```
FAIL
```

The provided code has several points of dissonance with the Project Constitution (DNA):

1. **Violation of 2.2. API & AI Flow Design:** The `getCapitals` function uses a Cloud Function named `getCombinedCapitals`.  The DNA mandates that all backend logic should be exposed via API routes in `src/app/api/`, not Cloud Functions directly.  While Cloud Functions are part of the backend, the prescribed architecture dictates their use within API routes or Genkit flows, not as direct access points.

2. **Violation of 1.4. Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives (Enforce Wholeness):** The DNA states that all API endpoints and Server Components returning data for display MUST aggregate data from at least two different Firestore collections representing different Capitals. The provided code, even assuming the `getCombinedCapitals` Cloud Function exists, doesn't guarantee this aggregation.  There's no visibility into the Cloud Function's implementation to confirm it adheres to the "Enforce Wholeness" directive.

3. **Potential Violation of 4. Security & Governance Mandates (Forced Backend Logic):**  The example usage suggests using `getServerSideProps`. This implies data fetching on the server, which is acceptable. However, the DNA mandates that client-side write access to core business data (like `capitals`) MUST be disabled.  While this code snippet doesn't directly violate this, it raises a flag because it doesn't demonstrate how write operations are prevented on the client-side.  The absence of security rules or backend-only mutation logic is a concern.

4. **Missing Error Handling in Example Usage:** The example usage in `getServerSideProps` lacks a `try...catch` block. The DNA mandates that all asynchronous operations must be wrapped in `try...catch` blocks for graceful error handling.

5. **Missing Unit Tests:** The DNA mandates unit tests for all backend logic.  There's no indication of accompanying tests for the `getCapitals` function or the implied `getCombinedCapitals` Cloud Function.

6. **Inefficient Data Fetching (Potential):**  The DNA emphasizes efficient data fetching and warns against deeply nested data. Without insight into the `getCombinedCapitals` function, it's impossible to determine if it adheres to these principles.  It's possible this function retrieves excessive data or uses inefficient queries.
