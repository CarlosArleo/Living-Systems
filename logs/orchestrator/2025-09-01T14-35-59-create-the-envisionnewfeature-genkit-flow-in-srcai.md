# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 2:35:59 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

Codebase Context: {codebaseContext}

The proposal should consider the following constraints and guidelines:

*   Adhere to the principles outlined in the project's architectural documentation.
*   Prioritize maintainability, testability, and scalability.
*   Provide clear justifications for design choices.
*   Include relevant code examples where appropriate.
*   Use Markdown formatting for clarity and structure.
```
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Error Handling:** The `envisionNewFeature` function lacks proper error handling. The `run` function from Genkit is asynchronous and could throw errors.  This violates the coding standards mandated in the CONSTITUTION (Section 3, Error Handling).
2.  **Missing Adherence to Regenerative Principles:** The prompt does not explicitly mention or enforce any of the regenerative principles outlined in the CONSTITUTION (Section 1.4). This is a critical omission, as it risks generating proposals that violate the core tenets of the project.
3.  **Potential Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** While not a direct injection vulnerability in this specific instance due to the intended use with codebase context, the prompt template itself is susceptible to injection if the `question` or `codebaseContext` variables are derived from user input without proper sanitization. This violates the "Secure by Default" mandate (Section 4).
4.  **Missing Justification in Prompt:** The prompt instructs the AI to "Adhere to the principles outlined in the project's architectural documentation" but doesn't provide the documentation itself or specific pointers to relevant sections. This violates the "Principle of Justification" (Section 6).

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Wrap the `run` function call in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors. Log the error and return a default value or re-throw the error as appropriate.
*   Incorporate specific regenerative principles into the prompt. For example, require the AI to explicitly address the "Enforce Wholeness" principle by asking how the proposed feature interacts with multiple Capitals.
*   Sanitize the `question` and `codebaseContext` inputs before inserting them into the prompt.  Consider using a templating library that handles escaping automatically.  Even if the current use case doesn't involve direct user input, this makes the code more robust and prevents future vulnerabilities.
*   Provide more context within the prompt itself.  Include summaries of key architectural principles and link to specific sections of the CONSTITUTION within the prompt text.  This reinforces the importance of these principles and guides the AI towards compliant solutions.  For example: "Ensure the proposal adheres to the Enforce Wholeness principle (see CONSTITUTION Section 1.4) by demonstrating how the feature interacts with at least two different Capitals."

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL

```

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** The `envisionNewFeature` function is vulnerable to prompt injection.  While the code attempts to sanitize the input by replacing curly braces, this is insufficient. A malicious user could still manipulate the prompt by using alternative syntax for variable substitution or by injecting instructions directly into the `question` or `codebaseContext` parameters. This could lead to the AI model executing unintended actions or revealing sensitive information.  This is a CRITICAL violation of Section 4, "Security & Governance Mandates."
2. **Violation of Constitution (Missing Tests):** The CONSTITUTION (Section 5) mandates unit tests for all backend logic and complex frontend utility functions. This flow represents backend logic (interacting with an AI model) and lacks accompanying unit tests. This is a violation of the testing mandates.
3. **Violation of Constitution (Missing Error Handling Detail):** While the code includes a `try...catch` block (as required by Section 3), the error handling is insufficient.  Simply logging the error to the console and returning a generic error message does not provide enough information for debugging or monitoring.  The specific error details should be logged and, ideally, reported to a centralized error tracking system. This violates the spirit of robust error handling mandated in Section 3.


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Fix Prompt Injection Vulnerability:**  Do not attempt to sanitize user input for inclusion in prompts. Instead, use a structured approach. Pass the `question` and `codebaseContext` as separate parameters to the `run` function and let the underlying AI framework handle the variable substitution securely.  Example using a hypothetical `run` function signature:
    ```typescript
    const result = await run({
      model: 'geminiPro',
      prompt: envisionPrompt,
      variables: { question, codebaseContext }, // Pass variables separately
    });
    ```
*   **Add Unit Tests:** Create unit tests using Vitest to verify the behavior of the `envisionNewFeature` function.  Test cases should include:
    *   Valid input: Verify that the function correctly calls the `run` function with the expected prompt and variables.
    *   Error handling: Simulate an error during the `run` call and verify that the error is logged and an appropriate message is returned.
*   **Improve Error Handling:**  Instead of just logging the error to the console, capture more detailed information about the error (e.g., error message, stack trace) and report it to a centralized error tracking service or a dedicated Firestore collection for system health monitoring (as described in the CONSTITUTION, Section 2.3).  Example:
    ```typescript
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in envisionNewFeature:", error);
      reportToErrorTracking(error); // Report error to tracking system
      return `An error occurred while generating the architectural proposal: ${error.message}`; // More informative error message
    }

    ```

});
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Adherence to Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The `envisionPrompt` is imported, but the file extension is not verified. The CONSTITUTION mandates that prompts reside in `.prompt` files, not `.ts` files. This is a critical vulnerability as it could lead to unintended code execution if a malicious TypeScript file masquerades as a prompt.
2.  **Incomplete Error Reporting (3. Coding Standards & Idioms):** The `reportToErrorTracking` function is a placeholder. While the `try...catch` block is present (which is good), the lack of actual error reporting to a centralized system or Firestore violates the implied requirement for robust error handling in a production-ready application.  This makes debugging and monitoring difficult.
3.  **Missing Security Considerations (4. Security & Governance Mandates):** The code interacts with an AI model (`geminiPro`) and uses `codebaseContext` as input.  There's no mention of sanitizing or validating this input. This opens the door to potential prompt injection attacks.  An attacker could manipulate `codebaseContext` to influence the AI's response in unintended ways, potentially exfiltrating sensitive information or generating malicious code.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Verify Prompt File Extension:**  Implement a check (e.g., during build time or at the beginning of the `envisionNewFeature` function) to ensure that the imported `envisionPrompt` file truly ends in `.prompt`.  If not, throw an error and halt execution. This prevents potentially malicious TypeScript files from being executed.
*   **Implement Robust Error Reporting:** Replace the placeholder `reportToErrorTracking` function with a proper implementation that logs errors to a centralized system (e.g., an error tracking service) or a dedicated Firestore collection (`system_health` as defined in the CONSTITUTION). Include relevant details like timestamps, user context (if available), and the full error object for effective debugging.
*   **Sanitize and Validate Inputs:** Implement input validation and sanitization for `codebaseContext`.  At a minimum, escape or remove any potentially harmful characters or sequences that could interfere with the prompt structure or allow for injection attacks. Consider using a library specifically designed for prompt sanitization.  Further, limit the size and complexity of `codebaseContext` to prevent overly large or complex prompts that could be abused or impact performance.
