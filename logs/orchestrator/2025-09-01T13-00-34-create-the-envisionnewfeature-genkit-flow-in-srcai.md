# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 1:00:34 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The `envision.prompt` does not fetch the prompt from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` as mandated by the CONSTITUTION. Instead, it defines the prompt inline.
    *   **Code Snippet:** The entire `envision.prompt` file.
    *   **Explanation:** This violates the principle of centralized prompt management and creates a potential for inconsistency and drift.

2. **Adherence to Constitution (6. Principle of Assumed Context):** The prompt within `envision.prompt` redundantly lists principles already defined in the CONSTITUTION.
    *   **Code Snippet:** The initial list of principles within the `render` function.
    *   **Explanation:** This violates the "Principle of Assumed Context" and bloats the prompt unnecessarily.  It assumes the AI agent doesn't have access to the CONSTITUTION, which is incorrect according to the defined protocols.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities (Potential for Injection Attacks):** The `codebaseContext` variable is directly injected into the prompt without any sanitization.
    *   **Code Snippet:** `${codebaseContext}` within the prompt template.
    *   **Explanation:**  A malicious actor could potentially craft a `codebaseContext` string that manipulates the prompt itself, leading to unexpected or harmful AI outputs. This is a classic prompt injection vulnerability.

4. **Readability & Maintainability (Lack of Comments):** The `envision.ts` file lacks comments explaining the *why* behind the code.
    *   **Code Snippet:** The entire `envision.ts` file.
    *   **Explanation:** While the code is relatively simple, a comment explaining the purpose of the `envisionNewFeature` function and its role within the larger architecture would improve maintainability.


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Remove the inline prompt from `envision.prompt` and replace it with a mechanism to fetch the correct prompt from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`. This could involve creating a utility function to load prompts from that file.
*   Remove the redundant principles from the prompt in `envision.prompt`.  Trust that the AI agent operates with the CONSTITUTION as its foundational context.
*   Sanitize the `codebaseContext` input before injecting it into the prompt.  Implement a robust sanitization strategy that escapes or removes potentially harmful characters and sequences.  Consider using a dedicated library for this purpose.
*   Add comments to `envision.ts` explaining the purpose of the function and its connection to the overall architecture and the regenerative principles.  For example, explain why `runWithRetry` is used.

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL

## Attempt #2

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Security Vulnerabilities (Prompt Injection):**  While the code attempts to sanitize the `codebaseContext` in `envisionNewFeature` using `sanitizeInput`, the provided implementation in `sanitizationUtils.ts` is rudimentary and insufficient.  Simply escaping backticks and dollar signs is not enough to prevent a determined attacker from manipulating the prompt structure.  A malicious user could still inject instructions by using alternative escaping mechanisms, Unicode characters, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the markdown parser used within `getPrompt`.

    ```typescript
    // src/ai/utils/sanitizationUtils.ts
    export function sanitizeInput(input: string): string {
      // Insufficient sanitization.  Vulnerable to prompt injection.
      let sanitized = input.replace(/`/g, '\\`'); // Example: Escape backticks
      sanitized = sanitized.replace(/\$/g, '\\$'); // Example: Escape dollar signs
      return sanitized;
    }
    ```

2. **Adherence to Constitution (Master Prompts):** The CONSTITUTION mandates that "Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted."  While the code fetches the prompt from the specified file, it adds additional instructions ("Generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. Remember the CONSTITUTION.") within the `render` function of `getPrompt`. This modifies the master prompt and violates the CONSTITUTION.

    ```typescript
    // src/ai/utils/promptUtils.ts
    return {
      render: ({ question, codebaseContext }: { question: string; codebaseContext: string }) => `
      # Envision Prompt (Fetched from docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md)
      // ... other code ...
      Generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format.  Remember the CONSTITUTION. // Violation: Added instruction
      `
    };
    ```

3. **Readability & Maintainability (Error Handling):** The `getPrompt` function lacks error handling.  File system operations can fail (e.g., file not found, permissions issues).  The code should include a `try...catch` block to handle these potential errors gracefully, as mandated by the CONSTITUTION's coding standards.

    ```typescript
    // src/ai/utils/promptUtils.ts
    export async function getPrompt(promptKey: string) {
      const promptFramework = await fs.readFile('docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md', 'utf-8'); // Missing try...catch
      // ...
    }
    ```

4. **Readability & Maintainability (Prompt Management):** The current implementation of `getPrompt` relies on parsing a markdown file. While functional, this approach can become unwieldy and difficult to maintain as the number of prompts grows.  It also makes it harder to test and version individual prompts effectively.

    ```typescript
    // src/ai/utils/promptUtils.ts
    export async function getPrompt(promptKey: string) {
      const promptFramework = await fs.readFile('docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md', 'utf-8'); // Markdown parsing can become complex
      // ...
    }
    ```


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Robust Sanitization:** Replace the simplistic sanitization in `sanitizeInput` with a dedicated library designed for preventing prompt injection attacks. Research and implement a robust solution that considers various attack vectors, including escaping, encoding, and potentially even structural validation of the prompt.
*   **Strict Adherence to Master Prompts:** Remove the appended instructions from the `render` function in `getPrompt`.  The prompt fetched from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` should be used *exactly* as written, without modification.  If additional instructions are needed, they should be added to the master prompt file itself.
*   **Implement Error Handling:** Wrap the `fs.readFile` call in `getPrompt` within a `try...catch` block. Log the error and return a default prompt or throw an error to prevent unexpected behavior.
*   **Improve Prompt Management:** Consider refactoring prompt management to use a more structured approach, such as storing prompts as individual JSON or YAML files. This would improve organization, version control, and testability.  A dedicated prompt loading mechanism could then be implemented to fetch and cache prompts efficiently.

## Attempt #3

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The `envision.prompt` file lacks any reference to a specific prompt from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`. This violates the CONSTITUTION's mandate that all AI calls must use the exact corresponding prompt from that document.

   ```
   // src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt
   Generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format.  Remember the CONSTITUTION.
   ```

2. **Security Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL: Secrets Management):** While the provided code doesn't directly include secrets, the `envision.ts` file uses `runWithRetry` from `genkit` without specifying how the Gemini API key is being provided. This raises a red flag.  The CONSTITUTION mandates using a secret manager and environment variables.  The implementation details are missing, creating a potential vulnerability.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/flows/envision.ts
   const result = await runWithRetry({
       model: "gemini-pro-1.5",
       prompt: renderedPrompt,
   });
   ```

3. **Performance Bottlenecks (N/A in provided code, but potential issue based on CONSTITUTION):** The CONSTITUTION mandates that all new API endpoints and Server Components aggregate data from at least two different Firestore collections.  While this code doesn't interact with Firestore directly, it's crucial to highlight that any future integration with Firestore must adhere to this performance-related directive to avoid fetching data from multiple collections inefficiently.

4. **Readability & Maintainability (3. Error Handling):** While the `envisionNewFeature` function includes a `try...catch` block, the error handling is minimal.  It logs the error to the console and re-throws it.  This provides limited value.  More robust error handling, potentially with custom error types and specific error messages, would improve maintainability and debugging.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/flows/envision.ts
   catch (error) {
       console.error("Error in envisionNewFeature:", error);
       throw error; // Re-throw the error
   }
   ```

5. **Adherence to Constitution (1.3. Technology Stack):** The use of `fs/promises` and `path` for prompt loading is not explicitly forbidden, but it deviates from the spirit of the CONSTITUTION, which emphasizes a Next.js/Firebase environment.  Loading prompts at build time or using a Firebase function to serve prompts would be more aligned with the overall architecture.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/utils/promptUtils.ts
   import * as fs from 'fs/promises';
   import path from 'path';
   ```

6. **Security Vulnerabilities (Potential for Injection Attacks):** While `sanitizeInput` uses DOMPurify, it's crucial to understand the context of `codebaseContext`. If this context includes user-supplied data, there's still a potential for injection attacks if the sanitized content is then used in an unsafe way (e.g., directly injected into an HTML template without proper escaping).  The CONSTITUTION's "Secure by Default" principle requires a more thorough analysis of how this sanitized data is ultimately used.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/utils/sanitizationUtils.ts
   export function sanitizeInput(input: string): string {
     return DOMPurifyInstance.sanitize(input);
   }
   ```


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Replace the generic prompt in `envision.prompt` with the exact prompt from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` corresponding to the "envision" functionality.
*   Explicitly define and implement the secret management strategy for the Gemini API key used in `runWithRetry`.  Use environment variables and a secret manager as mandated by the CONSTITUTION.
*   When integrating with Firestore, ensure all data fetching adheres to the "Enforce Wholeness" directive by aggregating data from at least two different collections as required.
*   Implement more robust error handling in `envisionNewFeature`.  Use custom error types, provide more informative error messages, and consider logging errors to a centralized error tracking service.
*   Refactor prompt loading to align with the Next.js/Firebase architecture. Explore loading prompts at build time or serving them via a Firebase function.
*   Conduct a thorough security review of how the sanitized `codebaseContext` is used. Ensure proper escaping and context-aware sanitization to prevent injection attacks.

          AUDIT REPORT: ### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The `envision.prompt` file lacks any reference to a specific prompt from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`. This violates the CONSTITUTION's mandate that all AI calls must use the exact corresponding prompt from that document.

   ```

2. **Security Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL: Secrets Management):** While the provided code doesn't directly include secrets, the `envision.ts` file uses `runWithRetry` from `genkit` without specifying how the Gemini API key is being provided. This raises a red flag.  The CONSTITUTION mandates using a secret manager and environment variables.  The implementation details are missing, creating a potential vulnerability.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/flows/envision.ts
   const result = await runWithRetry({
       model: "gemini-pro-1.5",
