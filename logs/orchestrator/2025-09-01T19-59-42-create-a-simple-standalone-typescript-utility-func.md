# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 7:59:42 PM

## Task Description

```
Create a simple, standalone TypeScript utility function in a new file at 'src/utils/formatter.ts'...
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **1.4. Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives**

High-level principles are translated into concrete, non-negotiable technical rules here.

*   **Directive: Enforce Wholeness:** All new API endpoints and Server Components that return data for display **MUST** aggregate data from at least two different Firestore collections representing different Capitals. Code that queries only a single Capital is not permitted without explicit override.
*   **Directive: Mandate Potential-Based Framing:** All AI-generated text summaries (e.g., in a "Story of Place" flow) **MUST** conclude with a section titled "Latent Potential" that identifies opportunities and underutilized assets based on the input data. Summaries that only describe problems or deficits are incomplete.
*   **Directive: Engineer for Collaboration:** Any new feature that displays community-facing data (e.g., a "Story of Place" narrative) **MUST** be accompanied by a corresponding commenting/feedback feature, including the necessary UI components and Firestore subcollection for storing feedback. Stand-alone, non-interactive displays are not permitted.

```

**Chunk 3:**
```
## **3. Coding Standards & Idioms**

*   **Language:** TypeScript. `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json` is enabled and must be adhered to.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   `camelCase` for variables and functions.
    *   `PascalCase` for React components, types, and interfaces.
*   **Error Handling:** All asynchronous operations, API calls, and database interactions **MUST** be wrapped in `try...catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully and prevent crashes.
*   **Comments:** Comment the "why," not the "what." Explain the purpose and intent behind complex logic, especially in relation to a regenerative principle.

---


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
### **2.3. Firestore Data Modeling**

*   **Core Strategy:** Prioritize flattened, scalable data structures to ensure long-term performance and resilience.
*   **Golden Rule:** Use **root-level collections** for primary entities (e.g., `users`, `places`). Use **subcollections** for unbounded one-to-many relationships (e.g., `documents` under a `place`).
*   **CRITICAL Mandate:** **Avoid deeply nested data** in maps or arrays within a single document. This is an anti-pattern that violates our principles of scalability and resource efficiency. Refer to the table below for guidance.

#### **Table 1: Firestore Data Modeling Strategies (Decision Matrix)**

| Strategy | Description | Regenerative Impact | Agentic Prompt Cue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nested Data (Maps/Arrays)** | Storing data directly within a parent document. | **Low (Anti-Regenerative at Scale):** Inefficient data fetching, high costs, poor adaptability. **Usage is restricted to small, fixed-size, self-contained objects ONLY (e.g., an address).** | "Use a nested map for the user's address, as it is a small, self-contained object." |
| **Subcollections** | Creating a new collection under a specific document. | **High (Regenerative):** Promotes efficient, on-demand data loading. Highly scalable and adaptable. Reduces unnecessary data transfer, lowering costs and energy consumption. **This is the default choice for one-to-many relationships.** | "Use a `documents` subcollection under each `place` document, as the number of documents is unbounded." |
| **Root-Level Collections** | Separate, top-level collections linked by IDs. | **High (Regenerative):** Provides the most scalable and flexible foundation. Decoupled data allows for independent evolution of system parts. **This is the required choice for many-to-many relationships.** | "Create separate root-level collections for `users` and `organizations`. Model the many-to-many 'membership' relationship using a dedicated `memberships` linking collection." |

```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **4. Security & Governance Mandates (Non-Negotiable)**

*   **CRITICAL: Secrets Management:** No hardcoded secrets. All API keys and sensitive credentials must be managed via environment variables and a secret manager (e.g., Google Cloud Secret Manager) for production.
*   **CRITICAL: Secure by Default:** All Firestore security rules **MUST** be written to `allow read, write: if false;` at the root level. Access must then be explicitly and narrowly granted on a per-collection basis. Permissive rules are forbidden.
*   **CRITICAL: Forced Backend Logic:** Client-side write access to core business data (e.g., the `capitals` subcollection) **MUST** be disabled. All mutations must be forced through secure, authenticated, and validated backend Cloud Functions or Genkit flows using the Admin SDK.
*   **CRITICAL: Authentication Mandate:** All API routes and server actions that create or modify data **MUST** be protected and require a valid, authenticated Firebase user session. Public, unauthenticated write operations are forbidden.
