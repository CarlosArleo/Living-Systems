## Task Description

```
Test task: create hello world endpoint
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

```

**Chunk 2:**
```
## **4. Security & Governance Mandates (Non-Negotiable)**

*   **CRITICAL: Secrets Management:** No hardcoded secrets. All API keys and sensitive credentials must be managed via environment variables and a secret manager (e.g., Google Cloud Secret Manager) for production.
*   **CRITICAL: Secure by Default:** All Firestore security rules **MUST** be written to `allow read, write: if false;` at the root level. Access must then be explicitly and narrowly granted on a per-collection basis. Permissive rules are forbidden.
*   **CRITICAL: Forced Backend Logic:** Client-side write access to core business data (e.g., the `capitals` subcollection) **MUST** be disabled. All mutations must be forced through secure, authenticated, and validated backend Cloud Functions or Genkit flows using the Admin SDK.
*   **CRITICAL: Authentication Mandate:** All API routes and server actions that create or modify data **MUST** be protected and require a valid, authenticated Firebase user session. Public, unauthenticated write operations are forbidden.

```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **2.3. Firestore Data Modeling**

*   **Core Strategy:** Prioritize flattened, scalable data structures to ensure long-term performance and resilience.
*   **Golden Rule:** Use **root-level collections** for primary entities (e.g., `users`, `places`). Use **subcollections** for unbounded one-to-many relationships (e.g., `documents` under a `place`).
*   **CRITICAL Mandate:** **Avoid deeply nested data** in maps or arrays within a single document. This is an anti-pattern that violates our principles of scalability and resource efficiency. Refer to the table below for guidance.

#### **Table 1: Firestore Data Modeling Strategies (Decision Matrix)**

| Strategy | Description | Regenerative Impact | Agentic Prompt Cue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nested Data (Maps/Arrays)** | Storing data directly within a parent document. | **Low (Anti-Regenerative at Scale):** Inefficient data fetching, high costs, poor adaptability. **Usage is restricted to small, fixed-size, self-contained objects ONLY (e.g., an address).** | "Use a nested map for the user's address, as it is a small, self-contained object." |
| **Subcollections** | Creating a new collection under a specific document. | **High (Regenerative):** Promotes efficient, on-demand data loading. Highly scalable and adaptable. Reduces unnecessary data transfer, lowering costs and energy consumption. **This is the default choice for one-to-many relationships.** | "Use a `documents` subcollection under each `place` document, as the number of documents is unbounded." |
| **Root-Level Collections** | Separate, top-level collections linked by IDs. | **High (Regenerative):** Provides the most scalable and flexible foundation. Decoupled data allows for independent evolution of system parts. **This is the required choice for many-to-many relationships.** | "Create separate root-level collections for `users` and `organizations`. Model the many-to-many 'membership' relationship using a dedicated `memberships` linking collection." |

# **CONTEXT.md: The Project Constitution for the RDI Platform**


```

**Chunk 5:**
```
### **Preamble**

This document is the master context and single source of truth for the AI agent developing the Regenerative Development Intelligence (RDI) Platform. It is the ultimate authority on all matters of architecture, coding standards, security, and design. All generated code and system artifacts must strictly adhere to the principles and mandates defined herein. This is a living document, version-controlled alongside the source code, and serves as the long-term memory and evolving intelligence of the project.

```

### Generated Code (Attempt #1)

```typescript
```ts
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";

export const helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((request, response) => {
  response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
});

```
```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";
import { helloWorld } from "../index";

describe("helloWorld", () => {
  it("should return hello world", async () => {
    const req = { query: {} } as any;
    const res = { send: vitest.fn() } as any;

    // Call the function
    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
    // @ts-ignore
    helloWorld(req, res);

    expect(res.send).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Hello from Firebase!");
  });
});

```

```

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**
No material issues found.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**
* While not a material issue, consider adding a log message within the `helloWorld` function for debugging and monitoring purposes.  For example: `functions.logger.info("Hello World function triggered");`

**3. Verdict:**
PASS


## Attempt #2

### Corrected Code (Attempt #2)

```typescript
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";

export const helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((request, response) => {
  functions.logger.info("Hello World function triggered");
  response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
});
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**
No material issues found.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**
* While not a material issue, consider adding TypeScript types for `request` and `response` for better type safety.  This is a minor improvement and not required for a PASS.

**3. Verdict:**
PASS


## Attempt #3

### Corrected Code (Attempt #3)

```typescript
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";
import { Request, Response } from "express";

export const helloWorld = functions.https.onRequest((request: Request, response: Response) => {
  functions.logger.info("Hello World function triggered");
  response.send("Hello from Firebase!");
});
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**
No material issues found.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**
* While not a material issue, consider adding TypeScript types for `request` and `response` objects for better type safety.  This is a minor improvement and doesn't affect the core functionality or security.

**3. Verdict:**
PASS


## Final Outcome

**STATUS:** ❌ FAIL
**REASON:** ❌ Failed to produce passing code after 3 attempts.
