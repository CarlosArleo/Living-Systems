# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 2:47:34 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Violation of Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The `envision.prompt` file does not include any regenerative principles or directives from the CONSTITUTION. This violates the mandate that prompts must reflect the project's core principles.  This is a material flaw as it could lead to the AI generating proposals that are not aligned with the project's regenerative goals.
2. **Security Vulnerability (3. Security & Governance Mandates):** The `envisionNewFeature` function does not validate or sanitize the `question` and `codebaseContext` inputs. This opens the system to potential prompt injection attacks.  An attacker could manipulate these inputs to inject malicious instructions into the prompt, potentially leading to the AI generating harmful or unintended outputs. This is a critical security vulnerability.
3. **Missing Error Handling (3. Coding Standards & Idioms):** The `gemini.generate(prompt)` call lacks a `try...catch` block. This violates the mandatory error handling requirement and could lead to application crashes if the AI call fails for any reason (network issues, rate limiting, etc.).

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Incorporate Regenerative Principles into Prompt:**  Modify `envision.prompt` to include specific references to the regenerative principles and technical directives from the CONSTITUTION. For example, explicitly mention the Five Capitals framework, the requirement for "Latent Potential" sections in summaries, and the need for collaborative features.  This will guide the AI to generate proposals that are aligned with the project's core values.
*   **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization:** Sanitize the `question` and `codebaseContext` inputs before using them in the prompt.  At a minimum, implement basic input validation to check for unexpected characters or excessively long inputs. Ideally, use a more robust sanitization library to prevent any potential injection attacks.
*   **Add Error Handling:** Wrap the `gemini.generate(prompt)` call in a `try...catch` block. Log the error details for debugging and return a user-friendly error message or a fallback value in case of failure.

*   **Example of improved code:**
```typescript
// src/ai/flows/envision.ts
import { Gemini } from 'genkit';
import envisionPrompt from '../prompts/envision.prompt';

const envisionNewFeature = async (question: string, codebaseContext: string): Promise<string | null> => { // Return null on error
  // Basic input sanitization (replace with a more robust solution)
  const sanitizedQuestion = question.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s.,!?]/g, '');
  const sanitizedCodebaseContext = codebaseContext.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s.,!?]/g, '');


  const prompt = envisionPrompt
    .replace('{question}', sanitizedQuestion)
    .replace('{codebaseContext}', sanitizedCodebaseContext);

  try {
    const gemini = new Gemini({ model: 'gemini-pro-1.5' });
    const result = await gemini.generate(prompt);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating proposal:', error);
    return null; // Or a specific error message
  }
};

export default envisionNewFeature;
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Insufficient Input Sanitization (Security):** The current input sanitization in `envision.ts` is rudimentary and vulnerable to injection attacks.  While it removes some special characters, it doesn't prevent the injection of Markdown or HTML, which could lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the generated proposal is rendered directly in the UI.  This violates the "Secure by Default" mandate of the CONSTITUTION.
2. **Missing Error Handling (Correctness & Logic, Adherence to Constitution):** The `try...catch` block catches the error but only logs it to the console.  It returns `null`, but there's no mechanism to communicate the specific error to the calling function. This violates the error handling standards defined in the CONSTITUTION.  Furthermore, the calling function needs to handle the `null` return, which isn't guaranteed.
3. **Missing Adherence to Regenerative Principles (Adherence to Constitution):** The prompt mentions the Five Capitals framework and Latent Potential, but it doesn't enforce their inclusion in the generated response. The AI could easily ignore these instructions. This violates the "Mandate Potential-Based Framing" and "Enforce Wholeness" directives of the CONSTITUTION.
4. **Potential Performance Bottleneck (Performance Bottlenecks):**  The entire codebase context is passed to the prompt. For large codebases, this could become a significant performance bottleneck and increase the cost of Gemini calls.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Robust Input Sanitization:** Implement a more robust sanitization strategy.  Consider using a library like DOMPurify to sanitize HTML in the generated Markdown or escaping special characters relevant to Markdown.
*   **Detailed Error Handling:**  Instead of returning `null`, throw a specific error object with a descriptive message. This allows the calling function to handle the error appropriately and provide more informative feedback to the user.  Consider creating custom error types for different failure scenarios.
*   **Enforce Regenerative Principles in Prompt:**  Restructure the prompt to explicitly require sections for each of the Five Capitals and the Latent Potential.  Use stronger language to make these requirements non-optional.  For example, use a structured format like YAML or JSON within the prompt to force the AI to adhere to the required sections.
*   **Optimize Codebase Context:** Instead of passing the entire codebase, identify and pass only the relevant sections of the codebase to the prompt.  This could involve analyzing the user's question and selecting relevant files or functions.  Alternatively, pre-process the codebase into a summary or index that can be efficiently queried.
*   **Input Validation:** Add input validation for `question` and `codebaseContext` to ensure they are not empty or excessively long. This can prevent unnecessary API calls and improve the quality of the generated proposals.

**3. Verdict:**
FAIL

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Explicit Justification for Model Choice:** The CONSTITUTION mandates justifying architectural choices, including model selection.  The `envision.ts` flow uses `gemini-pro-1.5` without explanation. This is a violation of the **Principle of Justification** (Section 6). While `gemini-pro-1.5` might be a reasonable default, the lack of explicit reasoning in the code or a nearby comment makes it difficult to assess the suitability of the model for this specific task and potentially violates the intent of the CONSTITUTION.
2.  **Potential Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** While the code sanitizes the `codebaseContext` for length, it does *not* sanitize the `question` input. This leaves the prompt vulnerable to injection attacks. A malicious user could craft a `question` that manipulates the YAML structure or injects unwanted instructions into the prompt, potentially exposing sensitive information or altering the behavior of the AI. This violates the **Secure by Default** mandate (Section 4).
3. **Missing Error Handling for Truncation:** While the code truncates `codebaseContext` if it's too long, it doesn't provide any feedback to the user that this has happened. This could lead to confusion if the generated proposal is incomplete or inaccurate due to missing context. This impacts **Correctness & Logic** (Criterion 1).
4. **Unclear Purpose of DOMPurify:** The use of `DOMPurify.sanitize(result)` is puzzling. The prompt explicitly requests a YAML output.  Sanitizing a YAML string with DOMPurify, which is designed for HTML, is likely unnecessary and might even corrupt the YAML structure if it contains characters interpreted as HTML entities. This impacts **Correctness & Logic** (Criterion 1).


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Justify Model Choice:** Add a comment in `envision.ts` explaining the rationale for using `gemini-pro-1.5`. For example: "// Using gemini-pro-1.5 for its strong reasoning capabilities and ability to generate structured outputs, as required by the prompt."
*   **Sanitize `question` Input:** Implement input sanitization for the `question` parameter.  Consider using a library specifically designed for YAML escaping or a more general-purpose escaping function to prevent prompt injection.
*   **Handle Truncation Gracefully:**  If `codebaseContext` is truncated, either inform the user with a warning message or implement a mechanism to handle larger contexts (e.g., splitting the context and making multiple API calls).
*   **Remove or Justify DOMPurify:** Remove `DOMPurify.sanitize(result)`. If there's a specific reason to sanitize the YAML output, explain it clearly in a comment and ensure the sanitization method is appropriate for YAML.  If sanitization is needed for a different reason (e.g., displaying the YAML in a UI element later), perform the sanitization *after* the YAML parsing step, not on the raw string.

FAIL
