# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 2:14:03 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Error Handling (envision.ts):** The `run` function call lacks a `try...catch` block. This violates the mandatory error handling standard defined in the CONSTITUTION (Section 3, "Coding Standards & Idioms").  This could lead to unhandled exceptions and application crashes.
2.  **Missing Explicit Justification (envision.prompt):** While the prompt instructs the AI to justify architectural choices, it doesn't explicitly require referencing specific sections of the CONSTITUTION. This weakens the enforceability of the CONSTITUTION and increases the risk of deviations.
3.  **Potential for Prompt Injection (envision.prompt):** The direct inclusion of `codebaseContext` into the prompt without sanitization creates a vulnerability to prompt injection. A malicious actor could manipulate the `codebaseContext` input to alter the prompt's instructions and potentially extract sensitive information or redirect the AI's behavior.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Add Error Handling:** Wrap the `run` call in `envision.ts` with a `try...catch` block. Log the error and return a meaningful error message or throw a custom error.
    ```typescript
    try {
      const result = await run({
        model: 'gemini-pro-1.5',
        prompt,
      });
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in envisionNewFeature:", error);
      // Either return an error string or re-throw
      return "An error occurred during feature envisioning.";
      // throw new Error("Feature envisioning failed.");
    }

    ```
*   **Enforce Justification with Specific References:** Modify the prompt in `envision.prompt` to explicitly require referencing specific sections of the CONSTITUTION when justifying architectural choices. For example:  "Justify architectural choices by referencing the relevant section number and principle from the CONSTITUTION (e.g., 'Section 2.3, Golden Rule')."
*   **Mitigate Prompt Injection:** Sanitize the `codebaseContext` input before including it in the prompt.  Consider using a library specifically designed for prompt sanitization or escaping special characters that could interfere with the prompt structure.  At a minimum, wrap the `codebaseContext` in a Markdown code block within the prompt to prevent it from being interpreted as Markdown instructions.

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Latent Potential (CONSTITUTION Violation):** The prompt does not explicitly require the AI to identify opportunities and underutilized assets, violating the "Mandate Potential-Based Framing" directive (Section 1.4).
2.  **Missing Collaboration Requirement (CONSTITUTION Violation):** The prompt does not mandate the inclusion of a commenting/feedback mechanism for community-facing data, violating the "Engineer for Collaboration" directive (Section 1.4).
3.  **Potential Prompt Injection (Security Vulnerability):**  The `codebaseContext` variable is directly injected into the prompt without proper sanitization. While the provided code uses backticks to create a code block, this is insufficient to prevent potential prompt injection attacks.  An attacker could craft malicious codebase context that alters the prompt's structure and instructions.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Add Latent Potential Section to Prompt:** Modify the `envision.prompt` file to explicitly require a "Latent Potential" section in the generated proposal.  This section should focus on identifying opportunities and underutilized assets related to the proposed feature.
*   **Add Collaboration Requirement to Prompt:**  Modify the `envision.prompt` file to require a "Collaboration and Feedback" section in the generated proposal. This section should outline how community feedback will be collected and integrated.
*   **Robust Sanitization of `codebaseContext`:** Implement more robust sanitization of the `codebaseContext` before injecting it into the prompt.  Options include:
    *   Using a dedicated library for prompt sanitization.
    *   Escaping special characters relevant to the prompt structure (e.g., backticks, curly braces).  This requires careful consideration of the specific prompt syntax and potential escape sequences.
    *   Restricting the allowed characters in `codebaseContext` to a safe subset.

*   **Improve Error Handling:** While the `try...catch` block exists, the returned error message is generic.  Include more specific error information (without exposing sensitive details) to aid in debugging. For example, log the error object itself to the console in addition to returning a user-friendly message.

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Input Validation (Security):** The `codebaseContext` input is sanitized for Markdown rendering, but not validated for content.  A malicious user could inject arbitrary JavaScript into the `codebaseContext` which, if rendered in the frontend without proper escaping, could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
2.  **Missing Contextual Information (Correctness & Logic):** The prompt relies on the AI having access to the CONSTITUTION.  While the prompt mentions the CONSTITUTION, it doesn't provide the actual content.  This makes the prompt's request ambiguous and unreliable. The AI cannot be expected to adhere to rules it doesn't have access to.
3. **Missing Error Specificity (Readability & Maintainability):** The `catch` block returns a generic error message. This makes debugging difficult. More specific error messages, potentially including the error type or a portion of the error message itself (while being mindful of not leaking sensitive information), would improve maintainability.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation for `codebaseContext`.  Consider limiting the allowed characters, length, or using a library specifically designed for sanitizing code snippets.  Crucially, ensure that any output generated from this flow is properly escaped before being rendered in the frontend.
*   **Provide Context:**  Include the relevant sections of the CONSTITUTION directly in the prompt, or provide a mechanism for the AI to access it.  For example, you could provide a condensed version of the relevant rules as part of the prompt template.
*   **Improve Error Handling:**  Provide more specific error messages in the `catch` block.  Log the full error object for debugging purposes, but return a more user-friendly message that hints at the nature of the problem without revealing sensitive information.  Consider different error messages for different error types (e.g., network errors vs. AI model errors).  Example: `return "An error occurred during feature envisioning.  If this persists, please contact support and reference error code: AI_ENV_001";`
*   **Consider Rate Limiting (Performance & Security):**  While not strictly a flaw in the current code, it's a good practice to implement rate limiting on API endpoints that call AI models. This prevents abuse and helps manage costs.
