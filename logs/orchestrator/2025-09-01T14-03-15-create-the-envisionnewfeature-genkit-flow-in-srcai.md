# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 2:03:15 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The code does not retrieve the prompt from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` as mandated by the CONSTITUTION.  Instead, it uses a locally defined prompt.

    ```typescript
    // src/ai/flows/envision.ts
    import envisionPrompt from '../prompts/envision.prompt';
    ```

2. **Adherence to Constitution (1.4. Regenerative Principles as Technical Directives - Mandate Potential-Based Framing):** The prompt does not explicitly require the AI to include a "Latent Potential" section in its output, violating a core regenerative principle.

    ```typescript
    // src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt.ts
    // ... (No mention of "Latent Potential" in the prompt)
    ```

3. **Readability & Maintainability (Comments):** The code lacks comments explaining the *why* behind design choices. While the code is relatively simple in this case, the CONSTITUTION mandates comments explaining the intent, especially in relation to regenerative principles.  For example, why was Gemini Pro 1.5 chosen?  Are there resource consumption implications?

    ```typescript
    // src/ai/flows/envision.ts
    const result = await run({
        model: 'gemini-pro-1.5', // Lacks justification comment
        prompt,
    });
    ```

4. **Security Vulnerabilities (Injection):**  While not a direct injection vulnerability in the traditional sense, the `codebaseContext` variable is inserted directly into the prompt. If this context comes from an untrusted source (e.g., user input, a third-party API), a malicious actor could craft input that manipulates the prompt structure and potentially exfiltrate information or cause the AI to generate undesirable outputs. This is a prompt injection vulnerability.

    ```typescript
    // src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt.ts
    render: ({ question, codebaseContext }: { /*...*/ }): string => `
      ...
      **Codebase Context:**
      ${codebaseContext} 
      ...
    `,
    ```


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Fetch the prompt from the designated location in `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` as required by the CONSTITUTION.  This could involve creating a utility function to load prompts from this file.
*   Modify the prompt to explicitly require the AI to include a "Latent Potential" section in the architectural proposal, fulfilling the "Mandate Potential-Based Framing" directive.
*   Add comments explaining the rationale behind the choice of `gemini-pro-1.5` and any resource or cost considerations.  Also, document the intended source and expected format of `codebaseContext`.
*   Sanitize or validate the `codebaseContext` input before including it in the prompt.  Consider limiting the length, allowed characters, or escaping special characters to prevent prompt manipulation.  If the context is extensive, explore alternative approaches like providing it to the LLM via a separate context window or embedding mechanism.

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2. API & AI Flow Design):** The code uses `gemini-pro-1.5` directly within the `envisionNewFeature` flow.  The CONSTITUTION mandates that all AI calls must use prompts from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`. While the prompt itself is loaded from this file, the model selection is not part of the prompt. This creates a deviation from the standard and makes it harder to manage and track model usage across the project.
    *   **Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        const result = await run({
          model: 'gemini-pro-1.5',
          prompt,
        });
        ```
2. **Security Vulnerabilities (Injection - Theoretical):** While the code sanitizes `codebaseContext` using `JSON.stringify`, the prompt itself is constructed dynamically.  If the `question` parameter is not sanitized and comes from user input, it could lead to prompt injection.  This is a theoretical risk, as the context suggests this function might be called internally. However, the CONSTITUTION mandates security by default (4. Secure by Default), so all inputs should be sanitized regardless of their origin.
    *   **Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        const prompt = envisionPrompt.render({ question, codebaseContext: sanitizedCodebaseContext });
        ```
3. **Performance Bottlenecks (Model Selection):** The comment mentions `gemini-pro-1.5`'s superior performance but also acknowledges cost implications. The CONSTITUTION (Section 7) defines performance KPIs.  Using a more expensive model without explicit justification based on performance needs and budget considerations violates the spirit of the performance guidelines.
    *   **Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        // Using Gemini Pro 1.5 due to its superior performance in generating detailed
        // architectural proposals.  Consider resource consumption and cost implications
        // for production deployments.  (Readability & Maintainability - Comments)
        const result = await run({
          model: 'gemini-pro-1.5',
          prompt,
        });
        ```
4. **Readability & Maintainability (Prompt Management):** The `promptLoader` function is a placeholder.  The lack of a concrete implementation makes it impossible to assess its adherence to the CONSTITUTION's requirements for prompt management.  Specifically, it's unclear how the prompt file is structured and how prompt versions are managed. This makes the code incomplete and not ready for production.
    *   **Code Snippet:**
        ```typescript
        // Implement logic to parse the file (e.g., Markdown parsing) and extract
        // the prompt identified by promptId.  This is a placeholder for the actual
        // implementation, which would depend on the format of the prompt file.
        ```


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Move model selection into the prompt definition within `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`. This centralizes model management and ensures consistency.
*   Sanitize the `question` parameter using a suitable method (e.g., escaping special characters or using a library designed for prompt sanitization) to prevent potential prompt injection vulnerabilities.
*   Provide a concrete implementation for the `promptLoader` function, including error handling and prompt versioning.  Document the chosen prompt file format and parsing strategy.
*   Justify the use of `gemini-pro-1.5` with specific performance data or explain why it's necessary despite the cost implications, referencing the performance KPIs defined in the CONSTITUTION.  Consider using a less expensive model if performance requirements allow.

## Attempt #3

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Adherence to Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The CONSTITUTION mandates that all AI calls use prompts from `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`. The `envision.prompt` file is located in `src/ai/prompts/`, which is a deviation.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/flows/envision.ts
   const envisionPrompt = loadPrompt('src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt');
   ```

2. **Security Vulnerabilities (3. Security & Governance Mandates):** The `cleanString` function in `sanitizer.ts` provides extremely basic sanitization. This is insufficient for production and opens the system to potential injection attacks, especially if this sanitized input is later used in database queries or displayed directly in the UI.  While the comment acknowledges this, it doesn't mitigate the material security risk.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/utils/sanitizer.ts
   export const cleanString = (input: string): string => {
     // Basic sanitization to remove potential harmful characters.  Consider more robust sanitization
     // libraries for production environments.
     return input.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9\s.,!?-]/g, '');
   };
   ```

3. **Readability & Maintainability (3. Coding Standards & Idioms):** The `loadPrompt` function lacks comments explaining *why* certain choices were made (e.g., YAML parsing, Zod schema validation).  While the code is functionally correct, the lack of explanatory comments reduces maintainability.  Specifically, the intent behind the `MODEL: ${parsedPrompt.model}` prepended to the prompt is unclear.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/utils/promptLoader.ts
   return {
     render: (data: any): string => {
       // ... (missing comments explaining the 'why' of this logic)
       return `MODEL: ${parsedPrompt.model}\n${renderedPrompt}`;
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Correctness & Logic (1. Correctness & Logic):** The `loadPrompt` function catches and re-throws errors. While this might seem correct at first glance, it doesn't add any value and obscures the original error stack trace, making debugging more difficult.  The outer `try...catch` is sufficient.

   ```typescript
   // src/ai/utils/promptLoader.ts
   render: (data: any): string => {
       try {
           // ...
       } catch (error) {
           console.error("Error validating prompt data:", error);
           throw error; // Redundant throw
       }
   },
   ```


**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Move the `envision.prompt` file to the correct location specified in the CONSTITUTION (`docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md`).
*   Replace the simplistic `cleanString` function with a robust sanitization library designed for security (e.g., DOMPurify if the output is intended for HTML, or a more general-purpose library if not).  Clearly document the chosen library and its purpose.
*   Add comments to the `loadPrompt` function explaining the rationale behind YAML parsing, Zod schema validation, and the prepending of the model name to the prompt.  Consider if the model name is actually necessary or if it's a remnant of earlier iterations.
*   Remove the redundant `throw error` within the inner `try...catch` block of the `loadPrompt` function.


**3. Verdict:**
