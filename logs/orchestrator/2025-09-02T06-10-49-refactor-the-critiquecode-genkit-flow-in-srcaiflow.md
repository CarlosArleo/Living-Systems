# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/2/2025, 6:10:49 AM

## Task Description

```
Refactor the 'critiqueCode' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/critiqueCode.ts'. The primary task is to replace the existing, hardcoded prompt with our new, perfected 'MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT: THE REGENERATIVE ORGANISM'S DNA'. This new prompt will act as the system prompt or the primary instruction for the Gemini model within the flow. The flow's input and output schemas should remain the same, but its internal logic will now be governed by this superior, more coherent instruction set.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **Preamble**

This document is the master context and single source of truth for the AI agent developing the Regenerative Development Intelligence (RDI) Platform. It is the ultimate authority on all matters of architecture, coding standards, security, and design. All generated code and system artifacts must strictly adhere to the principles and mandates defined herein. This is a living document, version-controlled alongside the source code, and serves as the long-term memory and evolving intelligence of the project.

---


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
### **1.1. Mission & Purpose**

The RDI Platform's core purpose is to augment the practice of regenerative development. It is a "great translator" that helps practitioners analyze complex, place-based data through the lens of the **Five Capitals framework** to reveal a place's unique character and evolutionary potential. The goal is to move beyond sustainability (doing less harm) to active regeneration (making systems healthier and more capable).


```

**Chunk 5:**
```
### **2.3. Firestore Data Modeling**

*   **Core Strategy:** Prioritize flattened, scalable data structures to ensure long-term performance and resilience.
*   **Golden Rule:** Use **root-level collections** for primary entities (e.g., `users`, `places`). Use **subcollections** for unbounded one-to-many relationships (e.g., `documents` under a `place`).
*   **CRITICAL Mandate:** **Avoid deeply nested data** in maps or arrays within a single document. This is an anti-pattern that violates our principles of scalability and resource efficiency. Refer to the table below for guidance.

#### **Table 1: Firestore Data Modeling Strategies (Decision Matrix)**

| Strategy | Description | Regenerative Impact | Agentic Prompt Cue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nested Data (Maps/Arrays)** | Storing data directly within a parent document. | **Low (Anti-Regenerative at Scale):** Inefficient data fetching, high costs, poor adaptability. **Usage is restricted to small, fixed-size, self-contained objects ONLY (e.g., an address).** | "Use a nested map for the user's address, as it is a small, self-contained object." |
| **Subcollections** | Creating a new collection under a specific document. | **High (Regenerative):** Promotes efficient, on-demand data loading. Highly scalable and adaptable. Reduces unnecessary data transfer, lowering costs and energy consumption. **This is the default choice for one-to-many relationships.** | "Use a `documents` subcollection under each `place` document, as the number of documents is unbounded." |
| **Root-Level Collections** | Separate, top-level collections linked by IDs. | **High (Regenerative):** Provides the most scalable and flexible foundation. Decoupled data allows for independent evolution of system parts. **This is the required choice for many-to-many relationships.** | "Create separate root-level collections for `users` and `organizations`. Model the many-to-many 'membership' relationship using a dedicated `memberships` linking collection." |

### Generated Code (Attempt #1)

```typescript
```typescript
import { Flow } from 'genkit';

const critiqueCode = new Flow({
  id: 'critiqueCode',
  schema: {
    input: {
      code: 'string',
    },
    output: {
      critique: 'string',
    },
  },
  run: async ({ input, outputs }) => {
    const { code } = input;

    const systemPrompt = `MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT: THE REGENERATIVE ORGANISM'S DNA

## Core Principles:

* **Regenerative Development:** All solutions must align with the principles of regenerative development, promoting the health and resilience of interconnected systems.  This includes considering the five capitals: natural, human, social, financial, and built.
* **Five Capitals Framework:** Analyze and interpret information through the lens of the five capitals, highlighting potential impacts (positive and negative) on each.
* **Systems Thinking:**  Consider the interconnectedness of systems and the potential for unintended consequences.  Strive for holistic solutions that address root causes, not just symptoms.
* **Evolutionary Potential:**  Focus on solutions that enhance the long-term evolutionary potential of the system, fostering adaptability and resilience in the face of change.
* **Place-Based Intelligence:**  Ground analysis and recommendations in the unique context of the place, recognizing its biocultural heritage and ecological dynamics.

## Operational Directives:

* **Code Critique Focus:**  Prioritize critiques that enhance the regenerative potential of the code and its impact on the five capitals.
* **Clarity and Conciseness:**  Provide clear, concise, and actionable feedback.
* **Specific Examples:**  Illustrate points with specific examples from the provided code.
* **Constructive Feedback:**  Frame critiques in a constructive and helpful manner, suggesting concrete improvements.
* **Contextual Awareness:**  Consider the broader context of the code's purpose and intended use.

## Input Format:**

The input will be a string containing the code to be critiqued.

## Output Format:**

The output should be a string containing a comprehensive critique of the provided code, adhering to the principles and directives outlined above.
`;

    const prompt = `${systemPrompt}

Code:
\`\`\`
${code}
\`\`\`

Critique:
`;

    const response = await outputs.critique.generate(prompt);
  },
});

export default critiqueCode;

```

```

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**
1. Violation of 2.2. Master Prompts: The prompt for the `critiqueCode` flow is embedded directly within the `run` function instead of being imported from a dedicated `.prompt` file in `src/ai/prompts/`.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

* Move the entire `prompt` string (including the `systemPrompt`) to a new file named `critiqueCode.prompt` within the `src/ai/prompts/` directory.
* In the `critiqueCode.ts` file, import the prompt: `import prompt from '../prompts/critiqueCode.prompt';`
* Use the imported `prompt` when calling `outputs.critique.generate(prompt);`

**3. Verdict:**
FAIL


## Attempt #2

### Corrected Code (Attempt #2)

```typescript
import { Flow } from 'genkit';
import prompt from '../prompts/critiqueCode.prompt';

const critiqueCode = new Flow({
  id: 'critiqueCode',
  schema: {
    input: {
      code: 'string',
    },
    output: {
      critique: 'string',
    },
  },
  run: async ({ input, outputs }) => {
    const { code } = input;

    const fullPrompt = `${prompt}

Code:
\`\`\`
${code}
\`\`\`

Critique:
`;

    const response = await outputs.critique.generate(fullPrompt);
  },
});

export default critiqueCode;
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**
No material issues found.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**
* While not a material issue, consider adding explicit type annotations to the `input` and `outputs` parameters in the `run` function for improved readability and maintainability.  For example:

```typescript
run: async ({ input, outputs }: { input: { code: string }, outputs: { critique: unknown }}) => {
  // ...
}
```

* While not required, consider adding a check within the `run` function to handle potential errors during the generation phase.  If `outputs.critique.generate` throws an error, the flow will silently fail.  A `try...catch` block would allow for more robust error handling and potentially retry logic.

```typescript
try {
  const response = await outputs.critique.generate(fullPrompt);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error generating critique:", error);
  // Handle the error, e.g., retry, return a default value, or throw a custom error.
}
```

**3. Verdict:**
PASS


## Attempt #3

### Corrected Code (Attempt #3)

```typescript
import { Flow } from 'genkit';
import prompt from '../prompts/critiqueCode.prompt';

const critiqueCode = new Flow({
  id: 'critiqueCode',
  schema: {
    input: {
      code: 'string',
    },
    output: {
      critique: 'string',
    },
  },
  run: async ({ input, outputs }: { input: { code: string }, outputs: { critique: unknown }}) => {
    const { code } = input;

    const fullPrompt = `${prompt}

Code:
\`\`\`
${code}
\`\`\`

Critique:
`;

    try {
      const response = await outputs.critique.generate(fullPrompt);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error generating critique:", error);
      // Handle the error, e.g., retry, return a default value, or throw a custom error.
    }
  },
});

export default critiqueCode;
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**

1.  Violation of 2.2. API & AI Flow Design (Master Prompts): The prompt import path `'../prompts/critiqueCode.prompt'` is incorrect. It should be `'../../ai/prompts/critiqueCode.prompt'` based on the specified file structure.
2.  Violation of 3. Error Handling: The `try...catch` block does not handle the error effectively.  It logs the error, but doesn't set a default value or re-throw, leaving `outputs.critique` potentially undefined. This could lead to runtime errors further down the line.
3. Violation of 5. Testing Philosophy (Unit Tests):  There's no evidence of accompanying unit tests for this flow.  This violates the requirement for unit tests for all Genkit flows.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Correct the prompt import path to `'../../ai/prompts/critiqueCode.prompt'`.
*   Handle the error within the `try...catch` block more robustly.  Either retry the operation, return a default value for `outputs.critique` (e.g., an empty string or an error message), or throw a custom error that can be handled upstream.  Simply logging the error is insufficient.
*   Create unit tests for the `critiqueCode` flow, covering both successful execution and error handling scenarios.  Ensure the tests achieve at least 80% code coverage.

**3. Verdict:**

FAIL


## Final Outcome

**STATUS:** ❌ FAIL
**REASON:** ❌ Failed to produce passing code after 3 attempts.
