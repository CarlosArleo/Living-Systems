# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 2:10:51 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Error Handling (envision.ts):** The `run` function call lacks a `try...catch` block. This violates the mandatory error handling standard defined in the CONSTITUTION (Section 3, "Coding Standards & Idioms").  This could lead to unhandled promise rejections and application crashes.
2.  **Missing Explicit Justification for Model Choice (envision.ts):** The use of `gemini-pro-1.5` is not explicitly justified. While the CONSTITUTION mentions Gemini models, it doesn't mandate a specific one.  A justification comment referencing performance, cost, or capability trade-offs compared to other available models is required (CONSTITUTION, Section 6, "Principle of Justification").
3.  **Potential Security Vulnerability (envision.prompt):** The prompt template uses direct variable insertion (`{{codebaseContext}}`). If `codebaseContext` contains user-supplied data, this could lead to prompt injection vulnerabilities.  While the intent is likely to provide existing code as context, the lack of sanitization or escaping creates a potential attack vector.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Add Error Handling:** Wrap the `run` call in `envision.ts` with a `try...catch` block. Log the error and return a meaningful error message or throw a custom error to be handled upstream.
    ```typescript
    try {
      const result = await run({
        model: 'gemini-pro-1.5',
        prompt,
      });
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in envisionNewFeature:", error);
      // Either return an error string or throw a custom error
      return "An error occurred during feature envisioning."; 
      // throw new Error("Feature envisioning failed.");
    }

    ```
*   **Justify Model Choice:** Add a comment in `envision.ts` explaining the rationale behind using `gemini-pro-1.5`.  For example:
    ```typescript
    // Using gemini-pro-1.5 for its balance of performance and cost-effectiveness
    // in generating detailed architectural proposals.  Consider gemini-pro-2
    // for more complex scenarios if performance becomes a bottleneck.
    const result = await run({ 
        // ...
    });
    ```
*   **Mitigate Prompt Injection:** Sanitize or escape the `codebaseContext` variable before inserting it into the prompt template.  Consider using a templating engine with built-in escaping mechanisms or implement a custom sanitization function to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.  Alternatively, if the context is not user-provided, clearly document this assumption in both the flow and prompt files.  For example, in `envision.prompt`:
    ```markdown
    <!-- Assumes codebaseContext is sanitized server-side and does not contain user input. -->
    **Codebase Context:** {{codebaseContext}}
    ```
    And in `envision.ts`:
    ```typescript
    // codebaseContext is assumed to be sanitized before being passed to this function.
    const prompt = envisionPrompt.render({ question, codebaseContext });
    ```

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Violation of Constitution (Master Prompts):** The prompt assumes the entire project documentation is provided as context. The CONSTITUTION explicitly states: "In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context." While the comment mentions this assumption, the prompt itself doesn't include any mechanism to ensure this context is actually passed to the LLM. This violates the "Principle of Assumed Context" in the CONSTITUTION.
2.  **Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** While the comment states that `codebaseContext` is sanitized before being passed to the function, there's no actual sanitization happening *within* the `envisionNewFeature` function. This reliance on external sanitization creates a vulnerability. If the caller fails to sanitize the input, malicious code could be injected into the prompt, potentially allowing the LLM to generate undesirable outputs or even expose sensitive information.
3.  **Missing Justification (Model Selection):** The code comments mention the rationale for choosing `gemini-pro-1.5`, but this justification needs to be more formally documented and linked to the performance KPIs defined in the CONSTITUTION. The "Principle of Justification" mandates explicit references to the relevant sections of the CONSTITUTION.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Explicitly Pass Context to Prompt:** Modify the `envision.prompt` file to accept a `projectContext` parameter and include it in the prompt.  This ensures the context is explicitly passed and not just assumed.  The `envisionNewFeature` function should then be updated to pass the relevant parts of the CONSTITUTION as an argument.
*   **Sanitize Input Within the Function:** Implement input sanitization *inside* the `envisionNewFeature` function using a well-defined sanitization library or method. This ensures that even if the caller fails to sanitize the input, the function remains secure.  Be explicit about *what* is being sanitized and *how*.
*   **Formalize Model Justification:** Add a section to the prompt explaining the model selection and explicitly referencing the "Max P95 Latency" and "Monthly Budget Threshold" KPIs from the CONSTITUTION's "Performance & Health KPIs" section.  This fulfills the "Principle of Justification" and provides clear documentation for future reference.  Consider adding dynamic logic to select the model based on the size/complexity of the `codebaseContext` and link this logic to the performance KPIs.
*   **Improve Error Handling:** While the `try...catch` block is present, the error handling could be improved. Instead of returning a generic error string, consider logging the specific error details (while being mindful of not leaking sensitive information) and throwing a custom error with a more descriptive message. This will aid in debugging and provide more context for error monitoring tools.  Consider different error types for different failure scenarios (e.g., `PromptInjectionError`, `ModelInvocationError`).

## New Feature Architectural Proposal

**Question:** {{question}}

**Codebase Context:** {{codebaseContext}}

**Project Context:** {{projectContext}}

Based on the provided question, codebase context, and project context, generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. This proposal should consider the existing system architecture (Next.js frontend, Firebase backend, Genkit AI orchestration) and adhere to the principles outlined in the provided project context.  The proposal should cover:

* **Proposed Solution Overview:** A high-level description of the proposed solution.
* **Technical Design:** Detailed explanation of the technical implementation, including any new components, data models, API endpoints, and Genkit flows.
* **Integration with Existing System:** How the new feature will integrate with the existing system.
* **Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:** Any potential challenges and how they will be addressed.
* **Testing Strategy:** How the new feature will be tested (unit, integration, E2E).

**Model Selection Justification:**

The model selected for this task is `{{model}}`. This choice is driven by the need to balance performance and cost, as mandated by the project context (section 7, "Performance & Health KPIs").  Specifically, the "Max P95 Latency" KPI of 800ms is a critical constraint.  For larger codebases, a more powerful model like `gemini-pro-2` might be necessary to meet this requirement, despite the potential impact on the "Monthly Budget Threshold" KPI.

The proposal should be formatted as a Markdown document, ready for inclusion in technical documentation.

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1. **Violation of CONSTITUTION (Secrets Management):** The `envision.prompt` file includes a dynamic insertion of the `model` parameter. While this specific instance only switches between allowed models, this pattern creates a vulnerability where a malicious actor could inject arbitrary model names, potentially leading to unauthorized access to more powerful or specialized models, violating the "Secrets Management" mandate (Section 4).
2. **Potential Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** While the code sanitizes `codebaseContext` using DOMPurify, it does not sanitize the `question` parameter. This leaves the prompt vulnerable to injection attacks. A malicious user could craft a question that manipulates the prompt structure, potentially extracting sensitive information from the `projectContext` or altering the generated proposal in unintended ways.
3. **Violation of CONSTITUTION (Master Prompts):** The prompt includes dynamic content related to model selection justification. This violates the principle of static master prompts defined in the CONSTITUTION (Section 2.2, "API & AI Flow Design").  The prompt should be self-contained and not include dynamically generated justifications.
4. **Maintainability Issue (Prompt Justification):** The justification for model selection is duplicated both in the code and the prompt. This creates a maintenance burden and potential for inconsistency.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

* **Remove Dynamic Model Insertion from Prompt:**  The model selection logic should reside exclusively within the `envisionNewFeature` function. The prompt should not contain any dynamic references to the chosen model.  Instead, the prompt should focus solely on the task description and desired output format.
* **Sanitize All User Inputs:** Sanitize the `question` parameter using DOMPurify, similar to the sanitization applied to `codebaseContext`. This will prevent prompt injection attacks. Consider a more general sanitization function that can be reused across all flows.
* **Move Model Selection Justification to Code Comments:** Remove the justification text from the prompt and place it as a detailed comment within the `envisionNewFeature` function, explaining the logic behind the dynamic model selection. This adheres to the CONSTITUTION's mandate for static master prompts and improves maintainability.
* **Centralize Model Selection Logic:** Consider creating a separate utility function for model selection based on context size. This would further improve code organization and reusability.
