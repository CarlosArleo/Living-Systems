# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 7:32:58 PM

## Task Description

```
Create a simple, standalone TypeScript utility function in a new file at 'src/utils/formatter.ts'...
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
## **3. Coding Standards & Idioms**

*   **Language:** TypeScript. `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json` is enabled and must be adhered to.
*   **Naming Conventions:**
    *   `camelCase` for variables and functions.
    *   `PascalCase` for React components, types, and interfaces.
*   **Error Handling:** All asynchronous operations, API calls, and database interactions **MUST** be wrapped in `try...catch` blocks to handle errors gracefully and prevent crashes.
*   **Comments:** Comment the "why," not the "what." Explain the purpose and intent behind complex logic, especially in relation to a regenerative principle.

---


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

---


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

### Generated Code (Attempt #1)

```typescript
```typescript
// src/utils/formatter.ts

export function formatString(input: string): string {
  return input.trim();
}
```

```

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**
No material issues found.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**
None. The function is simple, correctly typed, and fulfills a basic formatting need.  While the practical utility might be limited, it doesn't violate any rules.

**3. Verdict:**
PASS


## Attempt #2

### Corrected Code (Attempt #2)

```typescript
// src/utils/formatter.ts

export function formatString(input: string): string {
  return input.trim();
}
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**
No material issues found.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**
None. The function is simple, correctly typed, and fulfills its purpose.  While a more descriptive name like `trimWhitespace` might be preferable, it's not a material issue.

**3. Verdict:**
PASS


## Attempt #3

### Corrected Code (Attempt #3)

```typescript
// src/utils/formatter.ts

export function formatString(input: string): string {
  return input.trim();
}
```

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Material Issues Found:**
No material issues found.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**
None. The function is simple, correctly typed, and fulfills its purpose.  While a more descriptive name like `trimWhitespace` might be preferable, it's not a material issue.

**3. Verdict:**
PASS


## Final Outcome

**STATUS:** ❌ FAIL
**REASON:** ❌ Failed to produce passing code after 3 attempts.
