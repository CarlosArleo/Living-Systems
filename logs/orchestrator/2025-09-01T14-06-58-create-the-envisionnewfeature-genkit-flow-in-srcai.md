# Orchestrator Run Log: 9/1/2025, 2:06:58 PM

## Task Description

```
Create the 'envisionNewFeature' Genkit flow in 'src/ai/flows/envision.ts'. This flow must: 1. Accept 'question' (string) and 'codebaseContext' (string) as input. 2. Import its meta-prompt from a new file at 'src/ai/prompts/envision.prompt'. 3. Render the prompt with the inputs. 4. Call the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to generate a detailed architectural proposal in Markdown format. 5. Return the final Markdown proposal as a single string.
```

## Attempt #1

### Retrieved Context (RAG)

**Chunk 1:**
```
### **2.2. API & AI Flow Design**

*   **API Routes:** All backend logic is exposed via specific, single-purpose API routes in `src/app/api/`.
*   **Genkit Flows:** The core AI logic is encapsulated in Genkit flows located in `src/ai/flows/`. This isolates AI logic for maintainability and testing.
*   **Master Prompts:** Every AI call within a flow or API route **MUST** use the exact corresponding prompt from the `docs/AI_Prompt_Engineering_Framework.md` document. No inline or ad-hoc prompting is permitted.


```

**Chunk 2:**
```
### **2.1. Overall Architecture**

The system is a **Decoupled Full-Stack Application**. The frontend (Next.js) is responsible for the user experience, while the backend (Firebase Cloud Functions and Genkit) handles all business logic, data mutation, and AI processing.


```

**Chunk 3:**
```
### **1.3. Technology Stack**

*   **Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript, utilizing the App Router.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Component Library:** `shadcn/ui`. All UI elements must be constructed using these components to ensure consistency.
*   **Backend:** Firebase Platform (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
*   **AI Core:** Google's Gemini models, orchestrated via the **Genkit framework**.
*   **Mapping:** Mapbox GL JS for all frontend map components.


```

**Chunk 4:**
```
## **6. AI Agent Interaction Protocols (Meta-Rules)**

*   **Principle of Assumed Context:** In every prompt, you must operate as if this entire document has been provided as your foundational context. Your primary directive is to adhere to these rules above all else.
*   **Principle of Justification:** For significant architectural choices (e.g., selecting a data modeling strategy), you must explicitly justify your decision by referencing the relevant section and principle from this document.
*   **The Generator-Critique Mandate:** All generated code is considered a "draft" until it has been audited. A second AI agent, acting as a "Critique Agent," will review the draft against this constitution. Code is only considered "complete" after it has passed this audit.
```

**Chunk 5:**
```
## **5. Testing Philosophy**

*   **Unit Tests:** All backend logic (Cloud Functions, Genkit flows) and complex frontend utility functions require unit tests using **Vitest**.
*   **Integration Tests:** Critical user flows (e.g., document upload and analysis, stakeholder commenting) must be covered by integration tests.
*   **Code Coverage:** A minimum of **80%** unit test coverage is required for all backend logic. This will be enforced by the CI pipeline.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Key user journeys (e.g., the full authentication flow) will be tested using **Playwright**.

### Critique Report (Attempt #1)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  Missing Error Handling: The `envisionNewFeature` function lacks proper error handling. The `run` function from Genkit can throw errors, and these are not being caught. This violates the coding standards defined in the CONSTITUTION (Section 3, Error Handling).
2.  Missing Justification for Model Choice: The code uses `gemini-pro-1.5` without explanation. The CONSTITUTION (Section 6, Principle of Justification) mandates explicit justification for significant architectural choices, including model selection.
3.  Potential Performance Bottleneck: The `codebaseContext` parameter could be very large, potentially leading to large prompts and increased latency/cost.  This violates the performance KPI of Max P95 Latency (Section 7).
4.  Missing Adherence to Regenerative Principles: The prompt doesn't explicitly instruct the AI to consider the Regenerative Principles (Section 1.4) when generating the proposal. This risks generating architectures that don't align with the project's core mission.  Specifically, the prompt should mention the "Enforce Wholeness," "Mandate Potential-Based Framing," and "Engineer for Collaboration" directives.
5.  Missing Explicit Reference to Master Prompt Location: While the code correctly uses a separate prompt file, the CONSTITUTION (Section 2.2, Master Prompts) mandates a strict naming convention and location (`src/ai/prompts/`) which should be explicitly mentioned in a comment for clarity and maintainability.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   Wrap the `run` call in a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors. Log the error and return a default value or re-throw the error as appropriate.
*   Add a comment justifying the choice of `gemini-pro-1.5`.  Explain why this model is suitable for the task, considering factors like performance, cost, and capability.
*   Consider optimizing the `codebaseContext` parameter.  Instead of passing the entire codebase, identify and pass only the relevant sections.  Alternatively, explore using embeddings or other techniques to represent the codebase more efficiently.
*   Update the prompt to explicitly instruct the AI to consider the Regenerative Principles.  Include specific references to "Enforce Wholeness," "Mandate Potential-Based Framing," and "Engineer for Collaboration" and how they should influence the architectural proposal.
*   Add a comment explaining the location and naming convention of the master prompt file, referencing Section 2.2 of the CONSTITUTION.

### Critique Report (Attempt #2)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Missing Adherence to Constitution (2.2. Master Prompts):** The prompt does not explicitly mention the CONSTITUTION or provide a mechanism for the AI to access and adhere to it. This is a critical oversight, as it undermines the entire governance structure.  While the prompt mentions "adhering to principles outlined in the project's architectural documentation," it doesn't guarantee the AI has access to or will prioritize the CONSTITUTION.
2.  **Potential Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** The `codebaseContext` variable passed to the prompt is not sanitized or validated. This opens up a potential prompt injection vulnerability. A malicious actor could manipulate the `codebaseContext` to inject instructions into the prompt, potentially leading to the generation of insecure or undesirable code.
3. **Missing Adherence to Constitution (4. Security & Governance Mandates):** The prompt doesn't explicitly instruct the AI to generate code that adheres to the security mandates, particularly around secure-by-default Firestore rules and forced backend logic for data mutations.  This significantly increases the risk of generating insecure code.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Provide CONSTITUTION Access in Prompt:**  Modify the `envision.prompt` to explicitly provide the CONSTITUTION's content or a secure link to it within the prompt.  Add instructions emphasizing that the generated architecture *must* comply with the CONSTITUTION.  Example:  "The following is the project's CONSTITUTION: [CONSTITUTION CONTENT/LINK].  Your proposal MUST adhere to all rules and guidelines within this document.  Explicitly reference relevant sections of the CONSTITUTION to justify your architectural choices."
*   **Sanitize `codebaseContext` Input:** Implement input sanitization for the `codebaseContext` variable before passing it to the prompt. This could involve escaping special characters, limiting the length of the input, or using a library specifically designed for prompt sanitization.  Consider using a structured format for `codebaseContext` (e.g., JSON) to further reduce the risk of injection.
*   **Include Security Mandates in Prompt:**  Add explicit instructions to the prompt regarding security best practices.  Example: "All generated code must adhere to the following security mandates: 1. Firestore rules must be 'secure by default,' starting with `allow read, write: if false;`. 2. All data mutations must be handled through secure backend functions. Client-side writes are forbidden. 3. All API endpoints must require authentication."
*   **Enhance Error Handling:** While the `try...catch` block is present, the error handling could be improved. Instead of returning a generic error message, log the specific error details (while being mindful not to leak sensitive information) and consider using a more robust error reporting mechanism.  This will aid in debugging and monitoring.

### Critique Report (Attempt #3)

### Code Audit Report

**1. Issues Found:**

1.  **Constitution Violation (Master Prompts):** The `envision.prompt` file uses a placeholder `[INSERT_CONSTITUTION_CONTENT_OR_SECURE_LINK_HERE]` instead of dynamically importing the constitution content. This violates the architectural pattern mandating that prompts be self-contained and readily auditable.  This makes it impossible to guarantee adherence to the constitution without manual intervention.
2.  **Security Vulnerability (Prompt Injection):** The `cleanPromptInput` function in `promptUtils.ts` only escapes backticks. This is insufficient to prevent prompt injection.  A malicious user could craft input that modifies the prompt structure, potentially bypassing security constraints or causing the AI to execute unintended actions.  This is a CRITICAL security flaw.
3.  **Incomplete Error Handling:** While the `envisionNewFeature` function uses a `try...catch` block, the error handling is incomplete.  The `TODO` comment indicates the intention to implement more robust error reporting, but in its current state, errors are only logged to the console. This lacks proper alerting and could hinder debugging in a production environment.

**2. Suggested Improvements:**

*   **Fix Constitution Violation:**  Import the constitution content dynamically into the `envision.prompt` file. This could be achieved by loading the content from a `.md` file at build time or fetching it from a secure, read-only location at runtime.  Example (build-time import using a bundler plugin):
    ```typescript
    // envision.prompt
    ## New Feature Architectural Proposal

    **CONSTITUTION:**
    ```markdown
    {{CONSTITUTION_CONTENT}} // This would be replaced by the actual content at build time.
    ```
    // ... rest of the prompt
    ```
*   **Fix Prompt Injection Vulnerability:** Replace the placeholder implementation of `cleanPromptInput` with a robust sanitization strategy. This should include, at minimum:
    *   Input length limiting.
    *   Escaping or removing all special characters relevant to the prompt language (e.g., backticks, curly braces, newlines).
    *   Consider using a dedicated sanitization library designed for prompt engineering to ensure comprehensive protection. Example using a hypothetical `sanitizePrompt` function from a dedicated library:

    ```typescript
    import { sanitizePrompt } from 'prompt-sanitizer'; // Hypothetical library

    export const cleanPromptInput = (input: string): string => {
      return sanitizePrompt(input);
    };
    ```
*   **Complete Error Handling:** Implement robust error reporting in `envisionNewFeature`.  This should include:
    *   Integrating with an error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to capture and track errors in production.
    *   Providing more informative error messages to the user, while avoiding leaking sensitive information.
    *   Implementing appropriate fallback mechanisms or retry logic where applicable. Example:
    ```typescript
    try {
        // ...
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error in envisionNewFeature flow:", error);
        if (error instanceof Error) {
            // Log detailed error information for debugging
            console.error("Error details:", error.message, error.stack);
        }

        // Report error to monitoring service
        reportErrorToSentry(error); // Hypothetical function

        return "An error occurred while generating the proposal. Please try again later or contact support.";
    }
    ```
