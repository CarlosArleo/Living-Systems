Consider optimizing `expensive_operation` or using techniques like batch processing or asynchronous operations.\\n\\n4. **Readability & Maintainability (Issue #4):** Lack of Comments Explaining the 'Why'.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   x = calculate_something(a, b)\\n   y = x * 2\\n   return y\\n   ```\\n   While the code might be functionally correct, it lacks comments explaining the *purpose* of the calculations.  Why is `x` calculated in this way? What does `y` represent?  Good comments explain the intent and rationale behind the code, not just what the code is doing.\\n\\n5. **Readability & Maintainability (Issue #5):**  Cryptic Variable Names.\\n\\n   ```python\\n   def f(a, b):\\n       c = a * b\\n       d = c + 1\\n       return d\\n   ```\\n   Using single-letter variable names makes the code difficult to understand. More descriptive names (e.g., `product`, `result`) would greatly improve readability.\\n\\n\\n**2. Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n*   Implement thorough input validation in `process_data` to handle invalid input gracefully. Use try-except blocks and raise custom exceptions if necessary.\\n*   Sanitize all user-supplied data before using it in `execute_query` to prevent injection attacks. Use parameterized queries or appropriate escaping techniques.\\n*   Investigate opportunities to optimize the loop containing `expensive_operation`. Consider using batch processing, asynchronous operations, or other performance enhancement techniques.\\n*   Add comments to explain the *why* behind the code logic, not just the *what*.  Explain the purpose and intent of each calculation and variable.\\n*   Replace single-letter variable names with descriptive names that clearly convey their meaning and purpose.\\n\\n**3.
