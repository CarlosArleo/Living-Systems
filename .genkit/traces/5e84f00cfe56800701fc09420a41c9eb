This lack of explanatory comments hinders maintainability and understandability.\\n\\n5. **Readability & Maintainability (Missing Context - Potential for Excessive Complexity):**\\n   The provided code snippets are too small to judge overall code structure and modularity.  Larger functions or modules could suffer from excessive complexity, making them difficult to understand and maintain.  More context is needed.\\n\\n\\n**2. Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n* Implement robust input validation in `process_data` to handle non-integer inputs gracefully.  Sanitize and validate all user-supplied data before processing.\\n* **Never** construct SQL queries by string concatenation with user-supplied data. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection in `execute_query`.  Provide context on the origin of `query`.\\n* Investigate potential optimizations for the loop processing `collection`.  Consider batch operations or asynchronous processing if appropriate. Provide context on the size of `collection` and the nature of the operations within the loop.\\n* Add comments explaining the *purpose* and *reasoning* behind the code logic, not just *what* the code is doing.  Explain the \\\"why\\\" behind `calculate_something` and the multiplication by 2.\\n* Provide more code context to assess overall structure, modularity, and complexity.  Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable units.\\n\\n\\n**3.
