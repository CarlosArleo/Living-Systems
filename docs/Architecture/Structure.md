The Best Strategy: The Decoupled Firebase Project
We will not create a monorepo. Instead, we will create a workspace with two distinct, top-level projects: frontend and functions. A single firebase.json file at the root level will manage both, telling Firebase how to deploy them.
The Workflow:
Prototype the Frontend First: We will use the Firebase Studio agent for what it does best: rapidly generating the Next.js frontend UI/UX based on a detailed prompt. The agent will create a self-contained frontend application.
Initialize the Backend Manually: After the frontend is generated, we will use the Firebase CLI to create a separate functions directory. This is where all our backend logic, AI flows, and security rules will live.
Unify with Configuration: The root firebase.json will orchestrate everything, ensuring that when you deploy, the frontend goes to Hosting and the backend goes to Cloud Functions and Firestore.
This approach gives you a clean separation of concerns, allows for independent development, and is the standard for professional Firebase projects.
Step 1: The Master Prompt for the Firebase Studio Agent
Copy the entire text below and paste it into a new project in the Firebase Studio App Prototyping agent.
(Start of Prompt)
Subject: Generate the Frontend Prototype for a Map-Centric Regenerative Intelligence Platform
Hello! Please generate the initial frontend prototype for a new web application called the "Regenerative Development Intelligence (RDI) Platform."
IMPORTANT: Your primary task is to generate the Next.js frontend application ONLY. Do not create a functions or backend directory. The backend will be set up separately. The generated code should be a complete, runnable Next.js project.
1. Core Frontend Technology:
Framework: Next.js with TypeScript.
Styling: Tailwind CSS.
Firebase Integration: Please include and configure the Firebase Client SDK (v9/v10 modular). Create a configuration file (firebase/clientApp.ts) to initialize the connection to Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Storage).
2. Overall Layout & Design (Inspired by Kepler.gl):
The application must have a dark theme.
The layout should be dominated by a full-screen interactive map that fills the main content area.
There should be a persistent left-hand sidebar for controls and a collapsible, floating info panel in the top-right.
3. Required Pages & Components:
A. Login Page (/login):
Create a simple login page.
Include UI elements for Email/Password and Google Sign-In authentication.
B. Main Dashboard Page (/):
This page should be protected, requiring a user to be logged in.
Left Sidebar:
A header with the title "RDI Platform".
A dropdown menu labeled "Select a Place".
A prominent button labeled "+ Add Data".
An accordion-style list for "Layers" with these five items, each with a toggle switch:
Natural Capital
Human Capital
Social Capital
Manufactured Capital
Financial Capital
Main Map Area:
Integrate the Google Maps Platform JavaScript API.
Use a dark theme style for the base map.
The map should be interactive and ready to display data layers.
Top-Right Info Panel:
A floating, collapsible panel with a title and placeholder text. This will be used for the "Story of Place".
C. Add Data Modal:
When the "+ Add Data" button is clicked, open a full-screen modal.
The modal should contain a form with:
A dropdown to select one of the Five Capitals.
A file input for uploads.
A text field for a description.
A "Submit" button.
4. Final Instruction:
Please generate this complete Next.js frontend application. Ensure all components are created and the basic page navigation is functional.
(End of Prompt)
Step 2: Your Manual Setup (After the Agent Finishes)
Once the Firebase Studio agent has generated the frontend project, download the code. Do not run firebase init inside it. Instead, create a new parent directory for your entire workspace and place the frontend folder inside it.
1. Create the Workspace Structure:
code
Code
/rdi-platform-workspace  <-- Your new parent folder
  ├── frontend/           <-- The code generated by Firebase Studio
  └── ...
2. Initialize Firebase in the Workspace Root:
Open your terminal in the rdi-platform-workspace directory.
Run firebase init.
When prompted, select Firestore, Functions, Storage, and Hosting.
Firestore: Say yes to creating the rules and indexes files.
Functions: Choose TypeScript. Say yes to installing dependencies.
Hosting:
Set your public directory to frontend/out (for a static Next.js export) or just frontend if you plan to use a different deployment method.
Configure as a single-page app: No.
This will create a functions directory and a root firebase.json file.
3. Configure firebase.json:
Open the root firebase.json file and ensure it looks like this:
code
JSON
{
  "firestore": {
    "rules": "firestore.rules",
    "indexes": "firestore.indexes.json"
  },
  "functions": {
    "source": "functions",
    "predeploy": [
      "npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" install",
      "npm --prefix \"$RESOURCE_DIR\" run build"
    ]
  },
  "hosting": {
    "public": "frontend/out", // Adjust if needed
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ]
  },
  "storage": {
    "rules": "storage.rules"
  }
}
Important: Move the firestore.rules, firestore.indexes.json, and storage.rules files from the functions directory to the root of your workspace so they match this configuration.
4. Add Your Security Rules:
Open the firestore.rules file in the root and add the corrected rules from our previous discussion.
You now have a perfectly structured, decoupled project. The frontend is ready for UI development, and the functions directory is ready for you to build your backend logic and AI flows. This is the best possible foundation for your project.
