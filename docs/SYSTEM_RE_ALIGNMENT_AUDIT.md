# System Re-Alignment Audit Report

- **`genkit.config.ts`:** ❌ MISALIGNED - The file is missing the `constitutionTool` definition and the `flowPath` configuration, which are core components of the "Living System" architecture.
- **`generate.ts`:** ✅ ALIGNED - This is a simple, standalone Genkit flow focused exclusively on code generation as specified.
- **`critique.ts`:** ❌ MISALIGNED - While it contains the correct prompt logic, it does not use the `constitutionTool`. It incorrectly accepts the constitution as a simple string input, deviating from the specified architecture.
- **`correct.ts`:** ✅ ALIGNED - This is a simple, standalone Genkit flow focused on correction. It correctly takes dissonant code and feedback to produce a fix.
- **`orchestrator.ts`:** ✅ ALIGNED - This is a Genkit flow that correctly functions as the "brain," composing the generate, critique, and correct flows within a loop to manage the full development cycle.

**Overall Conclusion:** The system is not coherent and requires configuration adjustments before it can be tested, as the core `genkit.config.ts` is critically misaligned with the architectural blueprint.
