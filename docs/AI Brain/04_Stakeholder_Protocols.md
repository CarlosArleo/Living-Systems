# 04 Stakeholder Protocols: A Framework for Co-Creation

## Introduction: The Purpose of Engagement

In Regenerative Development and Design (RDD), stakeholder engagement is a fundamental departure from conventional practices. Conventional approaches often treat engagement as a tool for managing opposition, gathering feedback on a predetermined plan, or securing community "buy-in." <sup>1</sup> These relationships are typically transactional, aimed at extracting as much value or compromise as possible to move a project forward. <sup>1</sup>

A regenerative process, in contrast, is built on a foundation of co-creation and capacity building. Its purpose is not to manage stakeholders, but to "grow stakeholders"—to build their capability to see the whole system, understand their unique role within it, and become increasingly effective partners in co-evolving the health of their place. <sup>1</sup> The engagement process redefines stakeholders not as those who will be

_affected_ by a project, but as those who have a stake in the _enlarged potential_ that a project can help bring to their community and biosphere. <sup>1</sup> This shift transforms the dynamic from a defensive struggle over what currently exists to a collaborative exploration of what could be. The ultimate goal is to cultivate a "field of reciprocity" where exchanges are based on mutual benefit, intentionally designed to grow the vitality, productivity, and health of the whole system. <sup>1</sup>

## Phase 1: The Integral Assessment

**Objective:** To collaboratively build a foundational, whole-systems understanding of the place, which will serve as the coalescing context for all subsequent work. <sup>1</sup>

**Activities:**

- **Participatory Data Gathering:** Integrate quantitative and qualitative information from a wide range of sources, including GIS and historical mapping, archival research, and ecological studies. <sup>1</sup>
- **Identifying Knowledge Holders:** Reach out to and identify community members with deep, long-term knowledge of the place, including elders, Indigenous knowledge holders, long-term residents, farmers, and local historians. <sup>1</sup>
- **Story-Listening Sessions:** Conduct interviews and facilitate conversations with community members to record their stories and lived experiences. Use guiding questions such as: "What do you love about this place?" "What are the stories that represent 'who' this place is?" and "Where do you take visitors, and why?" <sup>1</sup>
- **Community Asset Mapping:** Look beyond problems to identify the unique assets and latent potential within the community and ecosystem, including underutilized skills, cultural traditions, and natural resources. <sup>1</sup>
- **Pattern Identification:** Analyze all gathered information to look for recurring patterns of relationships that reveal how the living system of the place organizes itself, sustains its health, and evolves over time. <sup>1</sup>

**Stakeholder Roles:**

- **Practitioners/Facilitators:** The practitioner's role is that of a "gardener," creating the conditions for the community to discover its own potential. <sup>1</sup> They guide the assessment process, integrate diverse forms of knowledge, and facilitate dialogue, but do not act as the sole "expert."
- **Community Members:** Community members, especially elders and long-term residents, are the primary holders of the "living memory" of the place. <sup>1</sup> They are the essential sources of the stories, values, and lived experiences that quantitative data cannot capture.
- **External Experts:** Specialists in fields like geology, hydrology, and history provide technical data that is woven into the larger narrative, but their information does not dominate the process.

## Phase 2: Synthesis and Story Development

**Objective:** To co-create the "Story of Place"—a coherent, science-based narrative framework that captures the unique identity, core organizing patterns, and evolutionary potential (or "vocation") of the place. <sup>1</sup>

**Activities:**

- **Community Story Circles & Roundtables:** The assessment team shares the initial findings and emerging patterns with the community in a dialogic format. <sup>1</sup> These sessions are designed for collective sense-making, not one-way presentation.
- **Narrative Co-Authoring Workshops:** Community members are invited to test, refine, and enrich the emerging story with their own experiences and knowledge. This collaborative process weaves together scientific data with lived experience, ensuring the final story is authentic and deeply resonant. <sup>1</sup>
- **Creating a "Story Field":** The ongoing dialogue creates a "story field"—a psycho-social space of shared meaning and deep connection that bridges divides, fosters collaboration, and aligns stakeholders around a common purpose. <sup>1</sup>

**Stakeholder Roles:**

- **Community Members:** Transition from being sources of information to becoming active co-authors and validators of the Story of Place. They take ownership of the narrative that defines "who" their place is. <sup>1</sup>
- **Practitioners/Facilitators:** Serve as weavers and synthesizers, helping to structure the narrative while ensuring it remains grounded in the community's authentic voice. Their role is to hold the space for the collective story to emerge.

## Phase 3: Guideline Co-Creation

**Objective:** To translate the co-created Story of Place into a guiding project concept and a set of actionable, place-sourced principles that will inform all subsequent design and development decisions. <sup>1</sup>

**Activities:**

- **Harmonization Workshops:** Facilitate a disciplined process to harmonize the potential of the place with the purpose of the project. This involves collectively envisioning the place's highest potential, appreciating the project's core purpose, and holding both in creative tension until a new, reconciling concept emerges that serves and elevates both. <sup>1</sup>
- **Co-Design Charrettes:** Engage stakeholders in intensive, collaborative design sessions to brainstorm interventions and physical designs that are direct expressions of the Story of Place and its guiding principles.
- **Nodal Intervention Prioritization:** In workshops, use the whole-systems understanding to collectively identify and prioritize nodal interventions—small, well-placed actions that can catalyze transformative, system-wide positive effects. <sup>1</sup>
- **Principle Drafting Sessions:** Collaboratively draft a set of place-sourced design and development guidelines that will serve as the "rulebook" for the project, ensuring its long-term alignment with the community's shared vision. <sup>1</sup>

**Stakeholder Roles:**

- **Stakeholders:** Evolve into co-designers of the project and long-term stewards of their place. They take ownership of the principles that will guide future development, transforming from opponents or observers into active partners. <sup>1</sup>
- **Practitioners/Facilitators:** Guide the translation process, ensuring the conceptual work is grounded and actionable. They help structure the co-creation of guidelines and facilitate the consensus-building process.
- **Stewarding Circle Formation:** A core group of diverse community members begins to form, tasked with "holding the whole" and stewarding the developmental process into the future, long after the initial project is complete. <sup>1</sup>

## Toolkit & Methodologies

The following are specific facilitation techniques and methodologies mentioned throughout the research that can be used to support the co-creation process:

- **Participatory Action Research:** An approach that treats research as a catalyst for community-driven regeneration, challenging the traditional expert role of the researcher through a more horizontal and collaborative process. <sup>1</sup>
- **Participatory Design:** A methodology that ensures the active involvement of all stakeholders throughout the design process, aiming to guarantee that the final outcome meets the identified needs of the community. <sup>1</sup>
- **Co-Design & Co-Production:** A set of collaborative practices where community members and practitioners work together as equal partners to design and create solutions, from initial concepts to physical implementation. <sup>1</sup>
- **Placemaking:** A hands-on, community-driven method to collectively reimagine and reinvent public spaces as the heart of a community, facilitating creative patterns of use that maximize shared value. <sup>1</sup>
