# 03 RDD Case Studies: A Library of Precedents

## Introduction: From Theory to Reality

This document serves as the RDI platform's library of real-world precedents. It translates the abstract principles of RDD into tangible, proven examples of successful interventions.

The purpose of this framework is to provide the AI with a deep well of "memories" and "experiences." When analyzing a new place, the AI will reference these case studies to find analogous situations, identify successful patterns, and ground its strategic recommendations in what has already been proven to work.

## Playa Viva Eco-Resort

1. Essence of Place:  
    The project is located on a 200-acre abandoned palm plantation adjacent to the declining village of Juluchuca, Mexico. The site was a severely degraded former estuary, a historically pivotal factor in the ecological health of the wider Sea of Cortez. 1
2. Core Challenge/Opportunity:  
    The initial concept was for a conventional resort that would extract resources from the village, compounding its decline. The opportunity was to transform the project into a vehicle for revitalizing the compromised local ecosystem and the struggling community. 1
3. Nodal Intervention:  
    After engaging with village elders, the project's core concept was "flipped" to the understanding that "the resort IS the village." The resort was reconceived as an instrument for regenerating the social and ecological health of its place, making its own economic success inextricably tied to the vitality of the surrounding community and ecosystem. 1
4. Principle Embodied:  
    Recognize Nested Systems
5. **Cross-Capital Impact:**

    - **Human Capital:** Provided extensive training to local community members in organic farming, waste reduction, and sustainable construction, building local skills and assets. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Social Capital:** Became a collaborator in the community, uncovering and promoting local history, which empowered residents and reversed youth out-migration. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Manufactured Capital:** Constructed an eco-resort with innovative casitas built as tree houses to stabilize the fragile dune ecosystem. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Financial Capital:** Created a continuously profitable business that provides stable local jobs, developed a fair-price salt co-op, and fostered an entrepreneurial local economy. <sup>1</sup>

## Las Salinas in Viña del Mar, Chile

1. Essence of Place:  
    Viña del Mar, a historic "Garden City" and major South American tourist destination, had fallen into decline due to unsustainable tourism. This resulted in the loss of community amenities, economic opportunities, and quality of life, causing young people to move away. 1
2. Core Challenge/Opportunity:  
    A developer's plan to build a large residential complex on a 19-hectare brownfield site was met with unified opposition from 25 separate community groups who saw the project as the final blow to their declining city. 1
3. Nodal Intervention:  
    The regenerative process shifted the scale of concern from the contentious 19-hectare site to the health of Viña del Mar as a "whole, living organism." By co-creating a "Story of Place" that articulated the city's potential for renewed health, the project was reframed as an instrument for realizing a shared, positive future. 1
4. Principle Embodied:  
    Work with Wholes
5. **Cross-Capital Impact:**

## Orillia, Ontario

1. Essence of Place:  
    A rural Canadian city with a dual identity, rooted in its history as the inspiration for Stephen Leacock's literary "Mariposa" and its more ancient Indigenous story as Mnjikaning, a "gathering together" place. 1
2. Core Challenge/Opportunity:  
    The city was facing a need for downtown revitalization and economic development and had an opportunity to create a coherent, authentic vision by drawing on its unique cultural and historical narratives. 1
3. Nodal Intervention:  
    Community roundtables initiated a "Story of Place" process, weaving together the Indigenous and literary narratives to establish a core identity for Orillia as a "place of meeting" and a destination for conversation and hospitality. 1
4. Principle Embodied:  
    Begin with Essence
5. **Cross-Capital Impact:**
    - **Natural Capital:** The process reconnected the community with its Indigenous history, which is deeply tied to the local ecology (e.g., "keepers of the fish fence"), fostering greater reverence for the land. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Human Capital:** The process redefined the role of citizens, encouraging them to become active story-keepers and fostering skills in dialogue, artistry, and shared meaning-making. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Social Capital:** A powerful, unifying vision was created that fostered an "ethic and culture of local hospitality" and aligned diverse community interests around a shared purpose. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Manufactured Capital:** The shared story directly informed the design of key public infrastructure, including a new library conceived as a community "meeting space" and the creation of a downtown "arts district." <sup>1</sup>
    - **Financial Capital:** The creation of a unique and attractive destination identity serves as the foundation for long-term economic development and tourism. <sup>1</sup>

## Forbes Building Affordable Housing

    The Forbes Building is a 147-unit affordable housing project built in 1970 in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. 1
2. Core Challenge/Opportunity:  
    While the building was being renovated to high green standards, the residents were viewed as passive recipients of services. The opportunity was to shift this dynamic and unlock the latent potential for residents to become active contributors to their community. 1
3. Nodal Intervention:  
    The project team facilitated a series of dialogues with residents that reframed their relationship with the community, helping them see that their housing was a gift that could be reciprocated through their own service and contributions. 1
4. Principle Embodied:  
    Develop a Field of Reciprocity
5. **Cross-Capital Impact:**
    - **Natural Capital:** The building itself was renovated to a Site Net Zero Energy Standard, significantly reducing its negative environmental impact. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Human Capital:** The process sparked a "creative surge of energy" among residents, building their sense of agency and their capacity to contribute to the community. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Social Capital:** A new, contributive, and reciprocal relationship was forged between the affordable housing residents and the wider community, strengthening the social fabric. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Manufactured Capital:** The 147-unit building was physically renovated to a high-performance, energy-efficient standard. <sup>1</sup>
    - **Financial Capital:** The collaborative, reciprocity-based approach saves significant time and money compared to conventional development processes that rely on negotiating compromises. <sup>1</sup>

## Esholt Positive Living

1. Essence of Place:  
    A masterplan site in Yorkshire, UK, that was physically disconnected from local amenities, making it very difficult for residents of the neighboring village to walk to the train station. 1
2. Core Challenge/Opportunity:  
    The project sought to go beyond simply being sustainable and aimed to create a development with a measurable, net-positive impact on its surrounding socio-ecological environment. 1
3. Nodal Intervention:  
    The project team implemented the Five Capitals framework to guide design and a small, physical intervention was made: connecting a single footpath that linked the neighboring village to the train station. 1
4. Principle Embodied:  
    Discover Nodal Interventions
