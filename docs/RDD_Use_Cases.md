# Regenerative Development Intelligence: Use Case Examples

This document outlines five practical examples of how the RDI platform can be used to derive powerful, regenerative insights by layering and analyzing data from the Five Capitals. These use cases illustrate the core "Work with Wholes" principle in action.

### Example 1: Discovering Health Inequities (Human + Manufactured Capital)

*   **Goal:** To understand if the city's infrastructure serves all residents equitably.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Upload a public health report (which the AI categorizes, extracting locations of clinics and areas with high asthma rates into **Human Capital**).
    2.  Upload a city zoning map and a bus route plan (which the AI categorizes, extracting industrial zones and bus stops into **Manufactured Capital**).
    3.  On the map, toggle **ON** only the "Human Capital" and "Manufactured Capital" layers.
*   **The Insight (What You See on the Map):** You immediately see a clear and disturbing pattern. The dots indicating high asthma rates (`Human`) are clustered in neighborhoods where the polygons of industrial zoning (`Manufactured`) are dominant. Furthermore, you see that these same neighborhoods have the fewest bus stops (`Manufactured`), indicating that the residents with the highest health burdens also have the poorest access to public transit. This visual evidence of an injustice was hidden in separate documents, but by layering them, the "whole system" view makes it undeniable.

### Example 2: Identifying Green Infrastructure Opportunities (Natural + Social Capital)

*   **Goal:** Find the best location for a new community garden that would have the biggest impact.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Upload a city survey on food deserts and social cohesion (the AI extracts areas of low grocery access and low community trust into **Social Capital**).
    2.  Upload a hydrological survey of the city (the AI extracts areas prone to flooding and with poor soil permeability into **Natural Capital**).
    3.  On the map, you toggle **ON** the "Natural Capital" and "Social Capital" layers.
*   **The Insight (What You See on the Map):** You spot a neighborhood where a large, "High Flood Risk" polygon (`Natural`) directly overlaps with a "Low Community Trust" area (`Social`). This is a nodal point. Building a community garden with bioswales here doesn't just address the food desert issue (`Social`); it also mitigates stormwater runoff (`Natural`) and creates a new shared space where neighbors can work together, directly building the social trust that was lacking (`Social`). You have found a single intervention that generates value across multiple capitals.

### Example 3: Uncovering Economic Resilience Gaps (Financial + Human Capital)

*   **Goal:** Understand why a specific part of town is struggling economically.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Upload local business census data (the AI extracts business locations and types into **Financial Capital**).
    2.  Upload a report on workforce skills and education levels (the AI extracts data on job skills into **Human Capital**).
    3.  On the map, you toggle **ON** only the "Financial Capital" and "Human Capital" layers.
*   **The Insight (What You See on the Map):** The map shows a cluster of struggling small businesses (`Financial`) in one part of town. When you overlay the `Human Capital` layer, you see that this exact area has a high concentration of residents with skills in trades and crafts, but very few with digital marketing or e-commerce skills. The insight is clear: the problem isn't a lack of talent, but a skills mismatch with the modern economy. Your intervention should not be a generic small business loan, but a targeted digital literacy and e-commerce training program for local artisans, unlocking latent potential.

### Example 4: Planning for True Walkability (Manufactured + Natural + Social Capital)

*   **Goal:** You want to make a neighborhood more walkable, but you want to do it in a meaningful way.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Upload maps of sidewalks, roads, and public buildings (`Manufactured Capital`), a tree canopy survey (`Natural Capital`), and a crime statistics report (`Social Capital`).
    2.  You toggle **ON** all three layers: "Manufactured," "Natural," and "Social."
*   **The Insight (What You See on the Map):** You notice a street that, according to the `Manufactured` layer, has a perfect sidewalk connection between a school and a library. Yet, when you add the other layers, you see the problem. The `Natural` layer shows this street has almost no tree canopy, making it unpleasantly hot in the summer. The `Social` layer shows it has a higher-than-average incidence of petty crime. The "whole system" insight is that a walkable community is more than just sidewalks. A truly regenerative solution would involve planting street trees (`Natural`) and initiating a "Safe Routes to School" community watch program (`Social`) to make the existing infrastructure (`Manufactured`) actually feel safe and pleasant to use.

### Example 5: Linking Ecological Health to Economic Value (Natural + Financial Capital)

*   **Goal:** Convince city council to invest in restoring a degraded wetland.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Upload a biodiversity report and flood maps for the wetland (`Natural Capital`).
    2.  Upload property value data and city flood damage insurance claim records (`Financial Capital`).
    3.  You toggle **ON** both the "Natural Capital" and "Financial Capital" layers.
*   **The Insight (What You See on the Map):** The map visually correlates the areas of lowest biodiversity and highest flood risk in the wetland (`Natural`) with the areas downstream that have the highest number of expensive flood damage claims and stagnating property values (`Financial`). You can now make a powerful economic case for ecological restoration. You can demonstrate that investing in regenerating the wetland's natural capacity to absorb water (`Natural`) is not a cost, but a direct investment that will reduce future insurance payouts and increase property values (`Financial`), providing a clear return on investment.
