# **Development Roadmap: The RDI Platform**

This document outlines the phased development plan for the RDI Platform, based on the tiered model in `Architecting Regenerative Intelligence.md`. It serves as the canonical checklist for tracking progress.

---

### **Tier 1: The Assessment & Visualization Platform (MVP)**
**Objective:** To build the core functionality for ingesting, analyzing, and visualizing place-based data. This tier provides immediate value to the Regenerative Design Practitioner.

- [ ] User Authentication & Profile Management
- [ ] Core Data Ingestion Flow
- [ ] "Integral Assessment" AI Engine
- [ ] Data Visualization Dashboard
- [ ] Foundational Governance

---

### **Tier 2: The Co-Creative & Dialogic Tool**
**Objective:** To build upon the MVP by adding features that enable the "Story of Place" methodology and facilitate stakeholder collaboration.

- [ ] "Story of Place" AI Synthesis
- [ ] Collaboration & Feedback Features
- [ ] User Roles & Permissions

---

### **Tier 3: The Predictive & Generative Engine**
**Objective:** To implement advanced, forward-looking features that enable simulation and generative design, representing the full vision of the platform.

- [ ] "Nodal Intervention Mapper" (Simulation)
- [ ] Constrained Generative Design Module
