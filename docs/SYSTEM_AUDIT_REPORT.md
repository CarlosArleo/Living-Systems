# RDI Platform: MVP Audit Report

### High-Priority Issues (Architectural & Security)
- **There are no high-priority architectural or security issues.** The previous refactoring successfully resolved the critical deviations in the data processing pipeline and closed the client-side write vulnerabilities. The system now correctly enforces all security and architectural mandates from the constitution.

### Medium-Priority Issues (Bugs & Performance)
- **Issue 1:** Inefficient Real-time Listener on `page.tsx`
  - **Problem:** The `useEffect` hook in `src/app/page.tsx` sets up a real-time `onSnapshot` listener for the main `place` document (`doc(db, 'places', selectedPlace.id)`). This listener is intended to update the Story of Place when it's generated. However, this creates unnecessary network traffic and processing, as the listener refires for *any* change to the main place document, even minor ones. The `AnalysisPanel` already fetches the complete, up-to-date data for the detail view via the `/api/places/[placeId]` endpoint when a place is selected. The real-time listener is therefore redundant and inefficient.
  - **Violation:** This violates the general performance and resource efficiency principles of our constitution ("Planet/Prosperity" pillars from the RSF). It creates unnecessary reads and client-side processing.
  - **Recommendation:** Remove the entire `useEffect` hook that sets up this `onSnapshot` listener from `src/app/page.tsx`. The existing data-fetching logic within the `AnalysisPanel` is sufficient and more efficient, as it only fetches the data once when needed.

### Low-Priority Issues (Code Style & Readability)
- **Issue 2:** Inconsistent Authentication Handling in Login Page
  - **Problem:** The `useEffect` hook in `src/app/login/page.tsx` contains a `getRedirectResult(auth).catch(...)` block. While functional, this pattern of catching a promise within a `useEffect` without handling the component unmounting can sometimes lead to state update attempts on an unmounted component, which is a React anti-pattern. A cleaner implementation would be to use a separate async function.
  - **Violation:** This is a minor deviation from the "Coding Standards & Idioms" which favor clarity and robust patterns.
  - **Recommendation:** Refactor the `useEffect` in `src/app/login/page.tsx`. Create a separate `async` function inside the effect to handle the `getRedirectResult` logic. This isolates the asynchronous operation and makes the code cleaner and more aligned with React best practices.
